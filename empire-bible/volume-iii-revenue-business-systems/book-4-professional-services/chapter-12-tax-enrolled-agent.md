# Chapter 12: Tax & Enrolled Agent Services

## Introduction

TaxEar Advisory LLC represents the "high authority" pillar of the Ohu-PNR Dynasty Empire. While notary work provides cash flow and transaction coordination provides operational glue, tax services provide *authority*. As an Enrolled Agent (EA), you are not just a service provider; you are a federally licensed tax practitioner with unlimited rights to represent taxpayers before the IRS.

This status elevates the entire brand ecosystem. It allows you to offer high-margin advisory services, defend your own real estate strategies (like REPS and Cost Segregation), and capture the recurring revenue of tax preparation and bookkeeping. This chapter outlines the path from exam preparation to building a scalable tax practice.

## Section 12.1: EA Exam Conquest Strategy

The Special Enrollment Examination (SEE) is a three-part exam. Passing it is the barrier to entry that protects your margins.

### Study Plan (Part 1, 2, 3, SEE)

**The "Sprint" Strategy**:
- Do not drag this out. Aim to pass all three parts within 3-6 months.
- **Part 1: Individuals**: Focus on income, deductions, and credits. (Study time: 4-6 weeks).
- **Part 2: Businesses**: Focus on partnerships, corporations, and specialized returns. (Study time: 6-8 weeks). *This is the hardest part.*
- **Part 3: Representation, Practices and Procedures**: Focus on ethics, appeals, and collections. (Study time: 3-4 weeks).

**Daily Routine**:
- **Morning (1 hour)**: Fresh concepts. Read new material.
- **Evening (1 hour)**: Review and practice questions.
- **Weekend (4 hours)**: Full mock exams.

### Resource Optimization

**Recommended Providers**:
- **Gleim**: The gold standard. Their test bank is harder than the actual exam. If you pass Gleim, you pass the SEE.
- **PassKey**: Good alternative, slightly more concise.
- **Fast Forward Academy**: Budget-friendly, good for quick review.

**Strategy**:
- Buy the "Premium" package with the adaptive learning technology. It focuses you on your weak areas.
- **Don't read the whole book.** Focus on the practice questions. Read the explanations for every wrong answer.

### Testing Strategies

**The "Flag and Move" Method**:
- You have 3.5 hours for 100 questions.
- If you don't know the answer in 30 seconds, **flag it and move on**.
- Answer the easy ones first to build momentum and bank points.
- Return to the flagged questions with remaining time.
- **Never leave a blank**. There is no penalty for guessing.

### Continuing Education

**Maintenance**:
- **Requirement**: 72 hours every 3 years (minimum 16 hours per year, including 2 hours of ethics).
- **Strategy**: Use CE to deepen your niche expertise (e.g., "Real Estate Taxation," "Crypto Taxation").
- **Provider**: Sequoia CPE or similar online bundles.

### Ethics Requirements

**Circular 230**:
- This is your bible. Read it. Know it.
- **Key Rule**: Do not be "willfully blind." If a client's numbers look fake, you have a duty to ask questions.

## Section 12.2: Tax Practice Development

Once licensed, you need clients. But not just any clients—you want high-value clients.

### Niche Selection

**The "Generalist" Trap**:
- Do not be "a tax guy for everyone." You will compete with H&R Block on price.
- **The TaxEar Niche**: **"Real Estate Investors & Small Business Owners."**
    -   Why? They have complex returns, they value planning, and they are willing to pay for it.
    -   Synergy: This feeds your Real Estate and TC businesses.

### Service Offerings

**1. Tax Preparation (Compliance)**
- 1040 (Individual): $500+
- 1065/1120S (Business): $1,200+
- **Value Add**: "We don't just file; we review for missed opportunities."

**2. Tax Planning (Advisory)**
- **The "Tax Blueprint"**: A comprehensive plan delivered in Q4.
- **Price**: $1,500 - $5,000.
- **Content**: Entity selection, retirement planning, vehicle deductions, hiring children, Augusta rule.

**3. Bookkeeping (Recurring)**
- **Price**: $300 - $1,000/month.
- **Why**: You can't do good tax returns with bad books. Control the data input.

### Pricing Strategies

**Value Pricing**:
- Never bill by the hour. Bill by the *form* or by the *value*.
- **The "Minimum"**: "Our minimum engagement fee is $500. If your return is simpler than that, you are better served by TurboTax."
- **The "Bundle"**: "Tax Prep + Quarterly Planning + Annual Bookkeeping review = $250/month." (Smooths cash flow).

### Client Acquisition

**The "Review" Offer**:
- "I will review your last 3 years of tax returns for free. If I find missed savings, I'll amend them for a fee. If not, you have peace of mind."
- **Conversion**: If you find savings, they become a client for life.

**Referral Partners**:
- **Financial Advisors**: They need a CPA/EA to refer to.
- **Real Estate Agents**: "I can help your investors calculate their after-tax ROI."

### Retention Programs

**The "Client Portal" Experience**:
- Use SuiteDash.
- Secure document upload (no email attachments).

## Section 12.3: IRS Representation Services

This is the "SWAT Team" service. High stress, high stakes, high fees.

### Audit Representation

**The Service**:
- Standing between the taxpayer and the IRS.
- **Fee**: $2,500 retainer + $250/hour.

**The "Pennies on the Dollar"**:
- Settling tax debt for less than the full amount.
- **Fee**: $3,000 - $5,000 flat fee.

- **Fee**: $250 - $500.
- **Value**: Stopping the levies and liens.

### Penalty Abatement

**The "First Time"**:
- Requesting First Time Abatement (FTA) for clean compliance history.

### Appeals Process

**The "Escalation"**:

### Tax Planning Services

**The "Q4 Sprint"**:

- Quarterly meetings to review P&L.
- "Your labor costs are up. Your margins are down. Let's fix it."
- **Fee**: $500/quarter.

### Financial Planning

**The "Holistic" View**:
- While you may not sell stocks (unless licensed), you advise on the *tax impact* of investments.
- "Selling that rental property will trigger $50k in tax. Let's look at a 1031 exchange."
