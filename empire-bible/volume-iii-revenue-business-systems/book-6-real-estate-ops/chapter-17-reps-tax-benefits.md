# Chapter 17: REPS Qualification & Tax Benefits

## Introduction

Real Estate Professional Status (REPS) is the "Holy Grail" of tax planning for high-income earners. Normally, rental real estate losses are considered "passive" and can only offset passive income (like other rental income). They cannot offset "active" income (like W-2 wages or business income).

REPS changes the rules. If you qualify, your rental losses become "non-passive," meaning they can offset **unlimited** active income. Combined with Cost Segregation and Bonus Depreciation, this can result in paying **zero** federal income tax, even with a high six-figure or seven-figure income.

For the Ohu-PNR Dynasty, achieving and maintaining REPS is a strategic imperative. This chapter details the strict requirements, documentation systems, and audit defense strategies needed to secure this powerful tax benefit.

## Section 17.1: Real Estate Professional Status

Qualifying for REPS is a two-step test. You must pass both.

### 750-Hour Requirement Planning

**Test 1: The Quantitative Test**:
- You must spend more than **750 hours** per year in real property trades or businesses in which you materially participate.
- **AND**: You must spend more than **50%** of your total working time in real property trades or businesses.

**The "W-2 Trap"**:
- If you have a full-time W-2 job (2,000 hours/year), you must spend 2,001 hours in real estate to pass the 50% test. This is nearly impossible.
- **Strategy**: One spouse qualifies. If one spouse has a W-2 job, the *other* spouse should aim for REPS. The benefits apply to the joint return.

### Material Participation Tests

**Test 2: The Qualitative Test**:
- You must "Materially Participate" in your rental activities.
- **The 7 Tests (You only need to pass ONE)**:
    1.  **500 Hours**: You participate for more than 500 hours during the year. (Most common).
    2.  **Substantially All**: Your participation constitutes substantially all of the participation in the activity (including non-owners).
    3.  **100 Hours + More than Anyone Else**: You participate for more than 100 hours, and no one else participates more.

**Grouping Election**:
- **Crucial Step**: You must make a formal election to "group" all your rental properties as a single activity.
- **Why**: Without grouping, you must meet the 500-hour test for *each property individually*. With grouping, you meet it for the portfolio as a whole.

### Documentation Systems

**The "Audit Proof" Log**:
- The IRS scrutinizes REPS heavily. "Ballpark estimates" are rejected.
- **Requirement**: A contemporaneous log identifying:
    -   Date.
    -   Time (Start/End).
    -   Description of Activity.
    -   Property Address.

**What Counts**:
- Managing tenants.
- Overseeing repairs.
- Buying materials.
- Marketing units.
- Screening tenants.

**What Doesn't Count**:
- Investor hours (reading financial reports).
- Travel time (unless it's to the property).
- "On call" time.

### Time Tracking Tools

**Technology**:
- **Toggl / Clockify**: Simple timer apps.
- **REPS Tracker**: Specialized app for real estate pros.
- **Google Calendar**: Detailed entries (e.g., "10:00-12:00: Repairing sink at 123 Main St").

### IRS Audit Defense

**Preparation**:
- Keep logs for 7 years.
- Keep receipts, emails, and texts that corroborate your log entries.
- **Narrative**: Be able to tell the story of your involvement. "I am the property manager. I handle everything."

## Section 17.2: Cost Segregation Strategies

Cost Segregation is the engine that generates the massive losses you need to offset your income.

### When to Segregate

**The Concept**:
- Standard residential depreciation is 27.5 years.
- Cost Segregation identifies components of the building that are "personal property" (5-year life) or "land improvements" (15-year life).
- **Examples**: Carpeting, cabinets, appliances, fencing, driveways.

**The Threshold**:
- Typically worth it for properties purchased for **$500,000+**.
- Can be worth it for lower values if you group multiple properties or use "DIY" software.

### Provider Selection

**Options**:
- **Full Engineering Study**: An engineer visits the property. Cost: $3,000 - $5,000. (Highest audit protection).
- **Desktop Study**: Based on photos and appraisal. Cost: $1,000 - $2,000.
- **Software/DIY**: Algorithms based on data. Cost: $400 - $800. (Good for smaller properties).

### ROI Calculations

**The Math**:
- Purchase Price: $1M.
- Land Value: $200k.
- Building Basis: $800k.
- **Without Cost Seg**: $29k depreciation/year.
- **With Cost Seg**: Reclassify 25% ($200k) to 5-year property.
- **Result**: Accelerate $200k of deduction into Year 1 (with Bonus Depreciation).

### Implementation Timing

**Tax Year**:
- You can do a Cost Seg study *after* the year ends, up until you file your return (including extensions).
- **Look Back**: You can do a "Look Back" study on properties owned for years and catch up all the missed depreciation in one year (Form 3115).

### Documentation Requirements

**The Report**:
- You must have a formal Cost Segregation Report on file to support the depreciation numbers on your tax return.

## Section 17.3: 1031 Exchange Mastery

When you sell, you pay tax. Unless you 1031.

### Exchange Types

**The "Swap"**:
- **Forward Exchange**: Sell Property A, Buy Property B.
- **Reverse Exchange**: Buy Property B first, then Sell Property A. (Complex/Expensive).
- **Construction Exchange**: Use the proceeds to build on land you own.

### Timeline Management

**The "45/180" Rule**:
- **Day 0**: Close on the sale of the Relinquished Property.
- **Day 45**: Deadline to *identify* potential Replacement Properties. (Strict).
- **Day 180**: Deadline to *close* on the Replacement Property.

### Qualified Intermediaries (QI)

**The "Middleman"**:
- You **cannot** touch the money. If the proceeds hit your bank account, the exchange is dead.
- **QI Role**: Holds the funds in escrow and transfers them to the new title company.

### Property Identification

**Rules**:
- **3-Property Rule**: Identify up to 3 properties. Close on any or all.
- **200% Rule**: Identify any number of properties, as long as total value < 200% of sold property.

### Boot Avoidance

**The "Leftover Cash"**:
- **Boot**: Any cash you keep or debt reduction you receive. Boot is taxable.
- **Goal**: Buy a property of equal or greater value, with equal or greater debt.

## Section 17.4: Depreciation Optimization

Maximizing the paper loss.

### Bonus Depreciation

**The "Supercharger"**:
- Allows you to deduct 100% (or phased down %) of the 5-year and 15-year property *in the first year*.
- **Schedule**:
    -   2022: 100%
    -   2023: 80%
    -   2024: 60%
    -   2025: 40%
    -   2026: 20%
    -   2027: 0% (Unless Congress extends it).

### Section 179

**The "Business Expense"**:
- Allows immediate expensing of business equipment (vehicles, furniture).
- Can be used for roofs, HVAC, and fire systems in commercial buildings.

### Improvement Classifications

**QIP (Qualified Improvement Property)**:
- Interior improvements to non-residential buildings.
- 15-year life = Eligible for Bonus Depreciation.

### Recapture Planning

**The "Clawback"**:
- When you sell, the IRS wants the depreciation back.
- **Tax Rate**: 25% on depreciation recapture.
- **Defense**: 1031 Exchange defers the recapture forever. "Swap 'til you drop."

### State Considerations

**Non-Conformity**:
- Some states (like PA or CA) may not conform to Federal Bonus Depreciation rules.
- You may have a loss for Federal but a gain for State. Plan accordingly.

## Chapter 17 Summary

REPS is not a loophole; it is a Congressional incentive to encourage real estate investment. By treating your real estate investing as a *business* rather than a passive investment, you unlock the ability to shelter your active income.

**Key Takeaways**:
1.  **Track Hours**: If you don't log it, it didn't happen.
2.  **Group Activities**: Make the election to treat all rentals as one activity.
3.  **Cost Segregate**: Accelerate depreciation to create massive Year 1 losses.
4.  **1031 Exchange**: Never pay capital gains tax; defer it until death (step-up in basis).

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Download a time-tracking app and start logging hours today.
- [ ] Review last year's return: Did you make the grouping election?
- [ ] Get a Cost Segregation quote for any property over $500k.
- [ ] Consult with TaxEar Advisory to confirm REPS eligibility.
