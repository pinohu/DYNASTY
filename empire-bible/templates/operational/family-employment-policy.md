# Family Employment Policy

## Purpose
To establish clear, merit-based rules for family members working in the Empire. This prevents nepotism and ensures business performance.

---

## 1. Philosophy
Employment in the Ohu-PNR Empire is a privilege, not a right. The business exists to serve the family's *capital*, not to provide the family with *jobs*.

## 2. Entry Requirements
To be considered for a permanent role in the business, a family member must:
1.  **Education**: Have the appropriate education/degree for the role.
2.  **Outside Experience**: Have worked successfully for at least **2 years** outside the family business.
3.  **Application**: Submit a formal application and resume.
4.  **Interview**: Interview with non-family managers/advisors.

## 3. Compensation
*   **Market Rate**: Compensation will be at Fair Market Value for the role, based on industry benchmarks.
*   **No "Family Tax"**: Family members will not be paid *less* than non-family employees.
*   **No "Family Premium"**: Family members will not be paid *more* than non-family employees.
*   **Perks**: Standard company perks apply. No special company cars or expense accounts unless the role requires it.

## 4. Performance Management
*   **Supervisor**: Whenever possible, family members should report to a non-family manager to ensure objective feedback.
*   **Reviews**: Family members are subject to the same performance review cycle as all employees.
*   **Termination**: Family members can be fired for poor performance or misconduct. Termination from the *business* does not affect their status as a *family member* or *beneficiary*.

## 5. Conduct
*   **Chain of Command**: Family members must respect the chain of command and not bypass managers to go to "Mom or Dad."
*   **Example**: Family members are expected to work harder and set a better example than anyone else.
