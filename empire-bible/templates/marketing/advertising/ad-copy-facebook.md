# Facebook/Meta Ads Copy Template

## Purpose

This template provides frameworks for writing effective Facebook and Instagram ad copy that stops the scroll and drives action.

## Instructions

1. **Know Your Audience**: Write in their language
2. **Lead with Hook**: First 3 words must grab attention
3. **Tell a Story**: Use narrative to engage
4. **Visual First**: Copy supports the image/video
5. **Clear CTA**: Make the next step obvious

## Template Structure

### Facebook Feed Ad

**Primary Text** (125 characters for best engagement):
> [HOOK - First 3 words critical]
> 
> [STORY OR BENEFIT]
> 
> [CALL TO ACTION]

**Headline** (40 characters):
> [BENEFIT OR OFFER]

**Description** (30 characters):
> [SUPPORTING DETAIL]

**CTA Button**: [Learn More / Shop Now / Sign Up / etc.]

## Ad Copy Variations

### Variation 1: Story-Driven

**Primary Text**:
> "I used to struggle with [PROBLEM]...
> 
> Then I discovered [SOLUTION].
> 
> Now I [BENEFIT].
> 
> Want the same results? [CTA]"

---

### Variation 2: Question Hook

**Primary Text**:
> "Are you tired of [PAIN POINT]?
> 
> You're not alone. Most [TARGET AUDIENCE] face this challenge.
> 
> Here's the solution: [BENEFIT]
> 
> [CTA] to learn more."

### Variation 3: Social Proof

**Primary Text**:
> "Join 10,000+ [TARGET AUDIENCE] who have [ACHIEVED RESULT]
> 
> [CLIENT NAME] said: '[TESTIMONIAL]'
> 
> Ready to get started? [CTA]"

---

### Variation 4: Offer-Driven

**Primary Text**:
> "🎉 Special Offer: [DISCOUNT]% Off
> 
> [PRODUCT/SERVICE] for just $[PRICE] (Regularly $[PRICE])
> 
> Limited time only. [CTA] to claim your discount."

## Instagram Ad Copy

**Caption** (Similar to Facebook, but shorter):
> [HOOK]
> 
> [BENEFIT]
> 
> [CTA]
> 
> [HASHTAGS]

**Note**: Instagram users prefer shorter, punchier copy.

## Best Practices

- **Hook**: First 3 words determine if they keep reading
- **Emojis**: Use sparingly (1-2 per post max)
- **Length**: Shorter often performs better (under 125 chars)
- **Questions**: Questions in first line increase engagement
- **Urgency**: "Limited time," "Only X left" create urgency
