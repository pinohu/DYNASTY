# Cold Outreach Email Template

## Purpose

This template is for initial contact with prospective clients. It is designed to be concise, value-driven, and low-pressure, aiming to start a conversation rather than close a sale immediately.

## Instructions

1.  **Research**: Identify the specific person (not generic "info@").
2.  **Personalize**: Use the [HOOK] to show you've done your homework.
3.  **Value**: Focus on *their* problem, not *your* features.
4.  **Call to Action (CTA)**: Keep it low friction (e.g., "worth a chat?").

## Template

**Subject**: [Question about their goal] / [Idea for their company]

Hi [FIRST NAME],

[HOOK: Mention a recent news item about them, a mutual connection, or a specific observation about their business].

I'm reaching out because I see many [INDUSTRY] companies struggling with [PAIN POINT]. We help companies like [CLIENT EXAMPLE] achieve [BENEFIT/RESULT] by [UNIQUE MECHANISM].

I'm not sure if this is a priority for you right now, but I thought it might be worth a brief conversation to see if we could help [COMPANY NAME] get similar results.

Are you open to a 10-minute chat next [DAY OF WEEK]?

Best,

[YOUR NAME]

## Example

**Subject**: Question about your notary workflow

Hi Sarah,

I saw on LinkedIn that ABC Title just opened a new branch in Austin – congratulations on the expansion!

I'm reaching out because I know scaling operations often creates bottlenecks with document signing. We help title companies like XYZ Title reduce closing delays by 40% with our on-demand mobile notary network.

I'm not sure if you're happy with your current signing service, but I thought it might be worth a brief chat to see if we could help ABC Title streamline this process.

Are you open to a 10-minute chat next Tuesday?

Best,

John Doe
