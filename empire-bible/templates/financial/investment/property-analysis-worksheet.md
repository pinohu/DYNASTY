## KEY METRICS

### Return on Investment (ROI)

**ROI** = (Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) × 100
**ROI** = ($[AMOUNT] / $[AMOUNT]) × 100 = **[PERCENTAGE]%**

### Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)

**Cap Rate** = (Net Operating Income / Purchase Price) × 100
**Cap Rate** = ($[AMOUNT] / $[AMOUNT]) × 100 = **[PERCENTAGE]%**

### Cash-on-Cash Return

**Cash-on-Cash** = (Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) × 100
**Cash-on-Cash** = ($[AMOUNT] / $[AMOUNT]) × 100 = **[PERCENTAGE]%**

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

**DSCR** = Net Operating Income / Annual Debt Service
**DSCR** = $[AMOUNT] / $[AMOUNT] = **[RATIO]**

*(DSCR > 1.0 indicates positive cash flow)*

### Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)

**GRM** = Purchase Price / Annual Gross Rent
**GRM** = $[AMOUNT] / $[AMOUNT] = **[MULTIPLIER]**
