# Cash Flow Forecast Template

## Purpose

This template helps businesses project future cash positions by estimating cash inflows and outflows over a specific period (usually 12 months). It is critical for avoiding liquidity crises and planning for capital expenditures.

## Instructions

1.  **Starting Balance**: Enter the actual cash balance at the start of Month 1.
2.  **Estimate Inflows**: Project sales receipts (consider payment delays/AR).
3.  **Estimate Outflows**: Project fixed costs (rent, payroll) and variable costs.
4.  **Calculate Net**: Inflows minus Outflows = Net Cash Flow.
5.  **Ending Balance**: Starting Balance + Net Cash Flow = Ending Balance.
