# Intellectual Property License Agreement Template

## Purpose

This template provides a comprehensive IP License Agreement for licensing intellectual property (trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets) between entities. This is particularly useful for inter-entity licensing within the Empire structure (e.g., ToriMedia licensing IP to operating companies).

**IMPORTANT**: This template must be reviewed and customized by qualified IP counsel before execution. IP-specific terms must be tailored to the licensed property.

## Instructions

1. **Identify Parties**: Replace [LICENSOR] and [LICENSEE] with actual entity names
2. **Define IP**: Complete Schedule A with detailed description of licensed IP
3. **Set Royalty Rate**: Establish arm's-length royalty rate (consult transfer pricing advisor)
4. **Define Scope**: Specify territory, term, and exclusivity provisions
5. **Review Transfer Pricing**: Ensure royalty rate complies with transfer pricing regulations
6. **Customize Terms**: Adjust terms based on specific IP and business needs
7. **Execute**: Have authorized representatives sign the agreement
8. **Record**: Record license with appropriate IP offices (if required)
