# Intercompany Loan Agreement Template

## Purpose

This template establishes a formal loan agreement between two related entities (e.g., a holding company and an operating subsidiary). It is critical for documenting the transfer of funds as a loan rather than a capital contribution or income, ensuring tax compliance and preserving the corporate veil.

**IMPORTANT**:
1.  **Interest Rate**: Must use at least the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) to avoid imputed interest issues.
2.  **Repayment**: Must have a defined schedule or demand provision.
3.  **Documentation**: Actual transfer of funds must match the agreement.

## Instructions

1.  **Identify Parties**: Lender (usually Holding Co) and Borrower (Operating Co).
2.  **Set Amount**: Specify the principal amount.
3.  **Determine Interest**: Check the current IRS AFR for the loan term (Short-term < 3 yrs, Mid-term 3-9 yrs, Long-term > 9 yrs).
4.  **Define Terms**: Set repayment schedule (monthly, quarterly, interest-only, or demand).
5.  **Execute**: Sign and date.
