## 12.1 EA Exam Conquest Strategy

The Enrolled Agent (EA) license is the highest credential awarded by the IRS. Unlike CPAs (state-licensed), EAs are federally licensed and can represent clients in all 50 states.

### The Exam (SEE - Special Enrollment Examination)
*   **Part 1: Individuals**: Income, deductions, estate tax.
*   **Part 2: Businesses**: Partnerships, Corps, S-Corps.
*   **Part 3: Representation**: Ethics, practice, procedures.

### Study Plan
1.  **Material**: Purchase a review course (Gleim, PassKey, or FastForward Academy).
2.  **Schedule**: Dedicate 1 hour/day.
    *   Month 1: Part 1
    *   Month 2: Part 2
    *   Month 3: Part 3
3.  **Testing**: Schedule exams 2 weeks apart. Don't cram them all in one week.

## 12.3 IRS Representation Services

This is "Crisis Management" for taxpayers. It commands high fees ($250+/hour).

### Services
*   **Audit Representation**: Standing between the client and the IRS auditor.
*   **Offer in Compromise (OIC)**: Negotiating to settle tax debt for pennies on the dollar (if qualified).
*   **Penalty Abatement**: Writing letters to remove penalties for "reasonable cause."

### The "Power of Attorney"
*   You must file Form 2848 to represent a client. This allows the IRS to talk to you instead of the client.

## 12.4 Year-Round Revenue Model

Tax season (Feb-April) is hell. We want consistent revenue.

### The Subscription Model
*   **Monthly Fee**: Charge clients a monthly subscription (e.g., $300/mo).
*   **Includes**: Annual Return + Quarterly Planning + Email Support.
*   **Benefit**: Smooths cash flow and reduces "bill shock" for the client.

### Cross-Selling
*   Tax clients need Notary services.
*   Tax clients need Transaction Coordination (if investors).
*   Tax clients need Estate Planning (Trusts).
*   *The Empire feeds itself.*
