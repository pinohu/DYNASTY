# Chapter 18: Property Management Systems

## Introduction

Acquiring property is the exciting part; managing it is where the money is actually made or lost. Property management is the operational backbone of real estate investing. A poorly managed asset will bleed cash, attract lawsuits, and destroy your REPS hours with low-value "firefighting" tasks. A well-managed asset generates consistent cash flow, appreciates in value, and provides tax benefits.

For Obuke LLC, the goal is to build a property management system that is scalable, compliant, and efficient. Whether you are self-managing to maximize cash flow and accumulate REPS hours, or managing a third-party property manager to scale, you need comprehensive systems. This chapter outlines the complete protocols for tenant screening, lease agreements, maintenance, rent collection, eviction procedures, property management transition, portfolio optimization, and multi-state expansion.

Property management is not a passive activity—it is active business management. Whether you do it yourself or hire it out, you must own the standards and the results. This chapter provides a complete operational blueprint for building a property management system that scales from self-management of a few properties to professional management of a large portfolio, generating consistent cash flow and maximizing property value.

This chapter covers every aspect of property management: self-management operations, property management transition, portfolio optimization, and multi-state expansion. Each section includes step-by-step implementation guides, templates, checklists, and real-world examples from successful property management operations.

## Section 18.1: Self-Management Operations

Self-management is often necessary in the early stages to maximize cash flow, accumulate REPS hours, and maintain control. As your portfolio grows, you may transition to professional management, but the systems you build during self-management will serve you well regardless of who manages the properties.
