## Section 16.1: Subject-To Acquisitions

### Legal Structures

Subject-To acquisitions involve purchasing property "subject to" the existing mortgage, where the buyer takes title but the seller's mortgage remains in place. Here's the legal framework:

**Legal Structure:**

1. **Title Transfer**
   - Buyer receives title via deed
   - Seller's mortgage remains in place
   - Buyer makes mortgage payments
   - **Risk**: Due-on-sale clause (rarely enforced)

2. **Due-on-Sale Clause**
   - Most mortgages have due-on-sale clauses
   - Lender can call loan due upon transfer
   - **Reality**: Rarely enforced for performing loans
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Maintain payments, avoid defaults

3. **Garn-St. Germain Act**
   - Federal law protects certain transfers
   - Applies to 1-4 unit residential properties
   - **Protection**: Transfers to family trusts exempt
   - **Strategy**: Use trust structures for protection

**Legal Best Practices:**

- **Consult Attorney**: Always consult real estate attorney
- **Document Properly**: Use proper legal documents
- **Disclose to Seller**: Full disclosure of Subject-To structure
- **Maintain Payments**: Never miss mortgage payments
- **Monitor Loan**: Track loan status regularly

Proper documentation protects all parties. Here's the documentation framework:

**Required Documents:**

1. **Purchase Agreement**

2. **Subject-To Addendum**
   - Acknowledges existing mortgage
   - Buyer responsibility for payments
   - Seller liability remains
   - **Purpose**: Clarify Subject-To structure

3. **Deed**
   - Warranty deed or quitclaim deed
   - Properly executed and recorded
   - **Purpose**: Transfer title

4. **Assignment of Rights**

## Section 16.5: The "Kitchen Table" Negotiation

Creative financing deals are not won on spreadsheets; they are won at the seller's kitchen table. You are solving a problem, not just buying a house.

### 16.5.1 The 4 Pillars of Motivation
To structure a creative deal, you must identify which pillar matters most to the seller. You can usually give them one or two, but not all four.

1.  **Price**: They want the highest number on the contract.
    *   *Strategy*: Give them their price, but on *your* terms (0% interest, 30-year amortization).
2.  **Speed**: They need cash *now* (foreclosure, divorce).
    *   *Strategy*: Cash offer (lower price) or "Hybrid" (cash for equity, payments for the rest).
3.  **Convenience**: They don't want to fix the roof or evict the tenant.
    *   *Strategy*: "I'll take it as-is, with the tenant."
4.  **Monthly Income**: They want cash flow without landlord headaches.
    *   *Strategy*: Principal-only payments or interest-only payments.

### 16.5.2 The "SubTo" Script
**Seller**: "Why would I let you keep my mortgage?"
**Investor**: "Mr. Seller, I understand your concern. Here is why it benefits you:
1.  **Debt Relief**: I start making payments immediately. Your debt-to-income ratio improves, allowing you to buy your next home.
2.  **Credit Repair**: Every time I make a payment on time, *your* credit score goes up. I am essentially a credit repair agency that pays *you*.
3.  **Speed**: If we wait for a bank to approve me, it takes 45 days. I can close in 7 days because I am taking over your payments."

### 16.5.3 Overcoming Objections
**Objection**: "What if you stop paying?"
**Response**: "Great question. We sign a 'Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure' and hold it in escrow. If I miss a payment, the property reverts back to you immediately. You get the house back, plus all the payments I made, plus the improvements I made. It's safer than being a landlord."

---

## Section 16.6: The "SubTo" Mechanics (Deep Dive)

The devil is in the details. One mistake in a Subject-To transaction can trigger the "Due-on-Sale" clause or leave the property uninsured.

### 16.6.1 The Due-on-Sale Clause Defense
The "Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982" prohibits lenders from enforcing the due-on-sale clause when a property is transferred into an *inter vivos trust* (living trust) where the borrower is a beneficiary.

**The Strategy**:
1.  Seller creates a Land Trust (e.g., "123 Main Street Trust").
2.  Seller transfers the deed to the Trust.
3.  Seller assigns the *Beneficial Interest* of the Trust to you (the Investor).
4.  **Result**: The deed shows a transfer to a Trust (protected). The assignment of interest is a private document not recorded publicly. The lender sees a trust transfer and usually ignores it.

### 16.6.2 Insurance Strategy
If you cancel the seller's insurance and buy a new policy, the lender gets a notification: "Policy Cancelled." This triggers an audit.

**The Solution**:
1.  Keep the seller's policy in place for 2-3 months.
2.  Get a new "Landlord Policy" in the name of the Trust.
3.  List the Seller as "Additional Insured".
4.  List the Lender as "Mortgagee".
5.  Once the new policy is active and the lender has accepted it, cancel the old policy.

### 16.6.3 Servicing the Loan
Never pay the lender directly with a personal check. It raises red flags.
*   **Use a Servicer**: Hire a third-party loan servicer (like Weststar or NoteServicingCenter).
*   **Process**: You pay the servicer. The servicer pays the lender.
*   **Benefit**: Creates an official paper trail of payments (crucial for refinancing later).

## Section 16.7: Private Money Compliance

Raising private money is the fuel for scaling, but the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) watches closely.

### 16.7.1 The "3-Touch" Rule (Rule 506(b))
Under Regulation D, Rule 506(b), you can raise unlimited capital from "Sophisticated Investors" *if* you have a pre-existing substantive relationship.

**What is a Substantive Relationship?**
The SEC generally looks for the "3-Touch" rule:
1.  **Touch 1**: Initial meeting/call. Discuss their goals, risk tolerance, and experience. *Do not pitch a deal.*
2.  **Touch 2**: Education. Send them your "Credibility Kit" or a case study of a past deal. *Do not pitch a deal.*
3.  **Touch 3**: The "Soft Ask". "If I find a deal that meets your criteria (8% return, 1st lien), would you be interested in seeing it?"
*   **Cooling Off Period**: Wait 30 days after the first meeting before accepting money.

### 16.7.2 The Credibility Kit
Before an investor gives you $100k, they need to trust you.
**Components**:
1.  **Bio**: Your background, education, and "Why Real Estate."
2.  **Team**: Your attorney, CPA, contractor, and property manager. (Shows you aren't a lone wolf).
3.  **Case Studies**: "Before & After" photos, HUD-1 settlement statements showing profits.
4.  **Sample Deal**: A hypothetical deal showing exactly how their money is protected (LTV, 1st Lien, Insurance).

---

## Section 16.8: The Novation Agreement

What if the seller owes too much for a cash offer, but doesn't want to wait for a SubTo? Enter the **Novation**.

### 16.8.1 The Concept
A Novation allows you to replace the original purchase contract with a new one, effectively allowing you to sell the property on the MLS *without* owning it yet.

**The Workflow**:
1.  **Contract**: Sign a purchase agreement with the seller for $200k.
2.  **Novation Addendum**: Includes language: "Seller agrees to allow Buyer to market property on MLS. Seller agrees to execute a Novation Agreement with the end buyer."
3.  **Renovation**: You spend $10k fixing the kitchen (access granted via agreement).
4.  **Listing**: You list it on the MLS for $280k.
5.  **Sale**: End buyer offers $275k.
6.  **Closing**:
    *   Seller gets their $200k.
    *   You get the difference ($75k - $10k repairs = $65k profit).
    *   You never paid closing costs or transfer taxes twice.

### 16.8.2 Legal Nuance
This is *not* wholesaling (assigning a contract). You are actually selling the property. You must have a "Power of Attorney" or specific "Listing Agreement" clause to legally list it. Consult a local real estate attorney.
