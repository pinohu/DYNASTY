# Chapter 7: Entity Formation & Compliance Bible

## Introduction

If the Dynasty Trust is the vault, the Business Entities are the soldiers. They go out into the world, take risks, earn money, and fight battles. If a soldier falls (gets sued), the vault remains safe.

This chapter is the definitive guide to forming, maintaining, and operating your Wyoming LLCs. We choose Wyoming for the same reason we choose South Dakota for trusts: it is the best jurisdiction for privacy and protection.

## 7.1 Wyoming Entity Formation - Complete Process

### Why Wyoming?
*   **Privacy**: Managers/Members are not listed on the public database.
*   **Charging Order Protection**: Creditors cannot seize the assets of the LLC; they can only get a "charging order" (a lien on distributions), which is useless if you don't distribute.
*   **Cost**: Low filing fees ($100) and annual reports ($60).
*   **Flexibility**: No operating agreement needs to be filed with the state.

### Step-by-Step Formation
1.  **Name Search**: Check availability on the Wyoming Secretary of State website.
2.  **Registered Agent**: You MUST hire a commercial Registered Agent in Wyoming (e.g., Wyoming Agents, Buffalo Registered Agents). Cost: ~$50/year.
    *   *Why?* They receive lawsuits so you don't have to. Their address goes on public record, not yours.
3.  **File Articles of Organization**:
    *   File online.
    *   **Organizer**: The Registered Agent should sign as the "Organizer" (keeps your name off the initial filing).
4.  **EIN**: Apply for the EIN on the IRS website *after* the LLC is approved.
    *   *Tip*: Use the Registered Agent's address as the mailing address if allowed, or a PO Box. Avoid your home address.

### Series LLC Implementation
For real estate (Obuke LLC), we use a **Series LLC**.
*   **Concept**: One "Parent" LLC can spawn unlimited "Child" Series (Series A, Series B, etc.).
*   **Benefit**: Each Series is liability-protected from the others. If a tenant sues Series A, they can't touch the assets in Series B.
*   **Cost**: You pay one filing fee for the Parent. The Children are free (in Wyoming).

## 7.2 Entity Documentation Requirements

Filing with the state is just the birth certificate. The **Operating Agreement** is the DNA. Without it, you are just a sole proprietorship in disguise.

### The Operating Agreement (OA)
*   **Must-Haves**:
    *   **Manager-Managed**: Designate PNR Holdings (or you) as the Manager.
    *   **EULA (Charging Order)**: Explicitly state that the exclusive remedy for creditors is a charging order.
    *   **Spousal Consent**: If married, spouse must sign to waive community property rights in a divorce (if applicable).
*   *See Template 7.2.1: Single-Member Operating Agreement.*

### Corporate Resolutions
Every major decision must be documented with a "Resolution."
*   Opening a bank account.
*   Buying a property.
*   Signing a lease.
*   *See Template 7.2.2: Corporate Resolution.*

### The "Corporate Veil" Checklist
To prevent a judge from piercing the veil:
1.  **No Commingling**: Never buy groceries with the business card.
2.  **Sign Correctly**: Always sign as "Ikechukwu Ohu, Manager," never just your name.
3.  **Capitalization**: Keep enough money in the account to pay bills.

## 7.3 Inter-Entity Agreements

Your companies will talk to each other. They need contracts, or the IRS will call it "Transfer Pricing fraud."

### Management Services Agreement
*   **Between**: CXI LLC (Management Co) and Operating Companies (e.g., Notroom).
*   **Terms**: CXI provides HR, Legal, Tech services in exchange for a monthly fee.
*   **Purpose**: Moves money from OpCos to CXI (S-Corp) for tax efficiency.

### IP Licensing Agreement
*   **Between**: ToriMedia (IP HoldCo) and Operating Companies.
*   **Terms**: OpCos pay a royalty (e.g., 5% of gross revenue) to use the brand/software.
*   **Purpose**: Moves money to a protected asset holding company.

### Intercompany Loan Note
*   **Between**: PNR Holdings (Bank) and OpCos.
*   **Terms**: PNR lends money for startup costs. OpCo pays interest.
*   **Purpose**: Repatriates profit to the HoldCo as "Loan Repayment" (tax-free) and "Interest" (taxable but deductible).

## 7.4 Compliance Calendar & Checklists

### Annual Requirements
*   **Wyoming Annual Report**: Due on the first day of the anniversary month. Cost: $60.
*   **Registered Agent Fee**: Pay annually.
*   **BOI Report (FinCEN)**: File Beneficial Ownership Information report (one-time, update if changes).

### Quarterly Requirements
*   **Board Meetings**: Hold a meeting of the Managers (even if it's just you). Document minutes.
*   **Distributions**: Calculate profit and make distributions to PNR Holdings.

### Monthly Requirements
