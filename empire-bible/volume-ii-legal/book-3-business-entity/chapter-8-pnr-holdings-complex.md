## 8.1 PNR Holdings LLC - Master Operations

PNR Holdings LLC is the master holding company that owns and controls all operating businesses, manages the Empire's treasury, and allocates capital according to the 70/20/10 Rule.

### Ownership and Control Structure

#### Ownership

**Owner**: South Dakota Dynasty Trust (99.999%) + [Primary Principal] (0.001%)

**Why 0.001% Personal Ownership**:
- Required for Real Estate Professional Status (REPS)
- REPS requires ownership in entities that own real estate
- 0.001% is minimal but sufficient
- Maintains trust control (99.999%)

**Manager**: [Primary Principal] (100% operational control)

**Jurisdiction**: Wyoming (privacy + protection)

#### Control Mechanisms

**Manager Control**:
- Manager has full operational control
- Makes all business decisions
- Manages day-to-day operations
- Reports to Trust Protector (oversight)

**Trust Oversight**:
- Trust Protector provides oversight
- Major decisions require Trust Protector approval (>$500,000)
- Family Council provides strategic input
- Trust maintains ultimate ownership

### The Treasury Function

PNR Holdings is the **only entity** that should hold significant cash. This is a critical asset protection strategy.

#### Cash Sweep System

**Operating Company Cash Management**:
- Operating companies maintain minimal cash (2 months expenses maximum)
- Excess cash "swept" to PNR Holdings monthly
- Operating companies operate with minimal cash reserves
- All excess cash centralized in PNR Holdings

**Sweep Process**:
1. **Monthly Review**: Review operating company cash balances
2. **Calculate Excess**: Determine cash above 2 months expenses
3. **Sweep Transfer**: Transfer excess to PNR Holdings
4. **Documentation**: Document all transfers
5. **Reinvestment**: PNR Holdings reinvests according to 70/20/10 Rule

**Why This Matters**:
- **Asset Protection**: If operating company sued, no cash to seize
- **Centralized Management**: All cash managed in one place
- **Capital Allocation**: Cash available for optimal allocation
- **Risk Isolation**: Operating company risk doesn't threaten cash

#### Detailed Cash Sweep Example

**Scenario**: RegIntel Advisors LLC has $150,000 cash at month-end. Monthly expenses are $25,000.

**Calculation**:
- Required Reserve: $25,000 × 2 = $50,000
- Excess Cash: $150,000 - $50,000 = $100,000
- Sweep Amount: $100,000

**Process**:
1. **Day 1**: Review RegIntel's bank statement
2. **Day 2**: Calculate excess ($100,000)
3. **Day 3**: Execute wire transfer from RegIntel to PNR Holdings
4. **Day 4**: Document transfer in both entities' books
5. **Day 5**: PNR Holdings allocates $100,000 per 70/20/10 Rule:
   - $70,000 to Operating Companies (growth capital)
   - $20,000 to Obuke (real estate)
   - $10,000 to Investments (diversification)

**Documentation Required**:
- Bank statements (both entities)
- Transfer confirmation
- Journal entries (both entities)
- Capital allocation decision memo
- Board resolution (if required)

#### Treasury Reserve Management

**Reserve Levels**:
- **Minimum Reserve**: 6 months operating expenses
- **Target Reserve**: 12 months operating expenses
- **Maximum Reserve**: 18 months operating expenses

**Reserve Calculation**:
- Sum all operating company monthly expenses
- Add PNR Holdings monthly expenses
- Add CXI monthly expenses
- Add Obuke monthly expenses
- Add ToriMedia monthly expenses
- Multiply by reserve months (12)

**Example**:
- RegIntel: $25,000/month
- Notroom: $15,000/month
- TaxEar: $10,000/month
- PNR Holdings: $5,000/month
- CXI: $20,000/month
- Obuke: $30,000/month
- ToriMedia: $2,000/month
- **Total**: $107,000/month
- **12-Month Reserve**: $1,284,000

**Reserve Investment Strategy**:
- **0-6 Months**: Money market accounts (immediate access)
- **6-12 Months**: Short-term Treasury bonds (slightly higher yield)
- **12+ Months**: Can be invested in growth assets

#### Cash Flow Forecasting

**Monthly Cash Flow Forecast**:
1. **Project Inflows**:

3. **Calculate Net Cash Flow**:

   - Add to beginning cash balance
   - Compare to reserve targets

4. **Adjust Allocations**:
   - If below minimum reserve: Reduce allocations
   - If above maximum reserve: Increase allocations
   - If within range: Maintain allocations

- Update allocation strategy
- Report to Trust Protector
