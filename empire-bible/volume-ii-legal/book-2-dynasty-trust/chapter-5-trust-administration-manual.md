# Chapter 5: Trust Administration Manual

## Introduction

A trust is like a high-performance car; it only works if you maintain it. If you treat the trust like your personal piggy bank (commingling funds, ignoring formalities), a judge will "pierce the veil" and declare it a sham. The South Dakota Dynasty Trust is a sophisticated legal structure designed to last 365 years, but it requires meticulous administration to achieve its goals.

This chapter is your **Owner's Manual** for trust administration. It details the critical tasks required to keep your Dynasty Trust compliant, secure, and bulletproof. Proper administration ensures:
- **Tax Compliance**: All tax obligations met, no penalties
- **Legal Protection**: Trust structure respected by courts
- **Asset Protection**: Creditor protection maintained
- **Beneficiary Support**: Distributions made appropriately
- **Long-Term Preservation**: Trust continues for 365 years

**Who Should Read This Chapter**:
- **Administrative Trustee**: To understand compliance requirements
- **Distribution Trustee**: To understand distribution standards
- **Trust Protector**: To understand when and how to exercise powers
- **Family Members**: To understand trust operations
- **Advisors**: To provide proper guidance

1. **Annual Administration Requirements** (Section 5.1): Tax filings, Crummey notices, accounting
2. **Distribution Standards & Guidelines** (Section 5.2): HEMS standard, age-based distributions, emergencies
