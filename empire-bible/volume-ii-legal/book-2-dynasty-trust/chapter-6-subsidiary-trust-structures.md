3. **Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT)** (Section 6.3): Tax-efficient charitable giving
4. **Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)** (Section 6.4): Valuation discount strategy

Each trust serves a specific purpose and integrates with the Dynasty Trust to maximize tax benefits and asset protection.

**Who Should Read This Chapter**:
- **Founders**: To understand subsidiary trust structures
- **Trustees**: To understand administration requirements
- **Advisors**: To implement these structures
- **Beneficiaries**: To understand trust benefits

## 6.1 Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)

The ILIT is an estate tax elimination vehicle that holds life insurance policies outside the estate, allowing death benefits to flow tax-free to the Dynasty Trust.

### Formation and Funding

#### Trust Formation

**Structure**: Sub-trust under South Dakota Dynasty Trust

**Purpose**: Hold life insurance policies to remove death benefits from estate

**Key Features**:
- Irrevocable (cannot be changed)
- Owns life insurance policies
- Beneficiaries have withdrawal rights (Crummey powers)
- Death benefits flow to Dynasty Trust

**Formation Process**:
1. Draft ILIT agreement (as sub-trust of Dynasty Trust)
2. Execute ILIT agreement
3. Obtain EIN for ILIT
4. Fund ILIT with initial contribution
5. Transfer life insurance policy to ILIT
6. Begin premium payments

**Timeline**: 30-60 days

#### Policy Selection and Transfer

**Current Policy**: Judith's $500,000 IUL (Indexed Universal Life) policy

**Policy Selection Criteria**:
- **Death Benefit**: Sufficient to cover estate tax exposure
- **Policy Type**: IUL, Whole Life, or Term (depending on needs)
- **Premium Structure**: Affordable and sustainable
- **Living Benefits**: Access to cash value if needed
- **Insurer Rating**: A+ or better

**Policy Transfer Process**:
1. Obtain policy assignment forms from insurer
2. Complete assignment forms
3. Transfer policy ownership to ILIT
4. Update beneficiary designation (ILIT as beneficiary)
5. Confirm transfer with insurer
6. Document transfer in trust records

**Important**: Policy must be transferred to ILIT **before** death to avoid estate tax inclusion.

#### Initial Funding

**Funding Amount**: $10,000-$25,000 recommended

**Purpose**: 
- Pay initial premiums
- Cover trust administration costs
- Provide working capital

**Funding Source**: Cash gift from settlors

**Gift Tax Treatment**: Uses annual exclusion ($18,000 per beneficiary in 2024)

### Crummey Power Mechanics

Crummey powers are essential for ILITs to qualify premium payments for the annual gift tax exclusion.

#### How Crummey Powers Work

**Step 1: Premium Payment**
- Settlors gift money to ILIT
- Gift amount equals premium due
- Gift made annually (or as premiums due)

**Step 2: Crummey Notice**
- ILIT trustee sends Crummey notice to beneficiaries
- Notice informs beneficiaries of withdrawal right
- Beneficiaries have 30 days to withdraw

**Step 3: Withdrawal Period**
- 30-day period for beneficiaries to exercise right
- Beneficiaries typically do not withdraw (they want policy to continue)
- Withdrawal period expires

**Step 4: Premium Payment**
- After withdrawal period expires, trustee pays premium
- Policy continues in force
- Gift qualifies for annual exclusion

#### Crummey Power Requirements

**Legal Requirements**:
- Beneficiaries must have withdrawal right
- Right must be exercisable
- Right must be meaningful
- Notice must be given

**Best Practices**:
- Send notices promptly
- Use certified mail
- Document all notices
- Track withdrawal periods
- Maintain complete records

#### Multiple Beneficiaries

**For [Your Organization] ILIT**:
- Beneficiaries: [Beneficiary Names] (four children)
- Each has withdrawal right
- Each receives Crummey notice
- Total withdrawal right: $18,000 × 4 = $72,000

**Annual Exclusion** (2024):
- Per beneficiary: $18,000
- Per couple (Ikechukwu & Judith): $36,000 per beneficiary
- Total for four children: $144,000 annual exclusion

**Premium Payment Strategy**:
- Premium: $X per year
- If premium < $144,000: Use annual exclusion
- If premium > $144,000: Use gift tax exemption for excess

### Premium Payment Strategies

#### Annual Premium Payments

**Strategy**: Pay premiums annually using annual exclusion

**Process**:
1. Calculate annual premium
2. Gift premium amount to ILIT (using annual exclusion)
3. Send Crummey notices
4. Wait 30 days
5. Pay premium to insurer
6. Repeat annually

**Benefits**:
- Uses annual exclusion (no gift tax)
- Simple and straightforward
- Predictable

**Limitations**:
- Limited by annual exclusion amount
- Requires annual gifting

#### Multi-Year Premium Payments

**Strategy**: Pre-fund multiple years of premiums

**Process**:
1. Calculate total premiums for 3-5 years
2. Gift total amount to ILIT
3. Send Crummey notices
4. Wait 30 days
5. Pay first year premium
6. Invest remaining funds
7. Use invested funds for future premiums

**Benefits**:
- Reduces annual gifting
- Allows investment growth
- Provides flexibility

**Limitations**:
- May exceed annual exclusion (use gift tax exemption)
- More complex administration

#### Policy Loan Strategy

**Strategy**: Use policy cash value to pay premiums

**Process**:
1. Build cash value in policy
2. Use policy loans to pay premiums
3. Repay loans from policy growth
4. Minimize out-of-pocket premium payments

**Benefits**:
- Reduces ongoing premium payments
- Uses policy's own growth
- Tax-efficient

**Limitations**:
- Requires policy with cash value
- Loans reduce death benefit
- Must manage loan balance

3. ILIT trustee receives death benefit
4. Death benefit distributed to Dynasty Trust (per ILIT terms)
5. Dynasty Trust receives death benefit tax-free
6. Dynasty Trust uses death benefit for beneficiaries

**Tax Treatment**:
- **Income Tax**: None (life insurance death benefits are income tax-free)
- **Estate Tax**: None (policy owned by ILIT, not in estate)
- **Gift Tax**: None (death benefit is not a gift)

**Result**: $500,000 death benefit flows to Dynasty Trust completely tax-free.

## 6.4 Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)

A GRAT allows transfer of appreciating assets to beneficiaries with reduced gift tax by retaining an annuity interest.

### Valuation Discount Strategies

#### How GRATs Work

**Step 1: Contribute Assets**
- Contribute appreciating assets to GRAT
- Assets valued at current fair market value
- Gift is remainder interest (after annuity)

**Step 2: Retain Annuity**
- Grantor receives annuity payments
- Annuity based on IRS discount rate
- Annuity payments reduce gift value

**Step 3: Asset Appreciation**
- Assets appreciate in GRAT
- Appreciation passes to beneficiaries
- Gift tax only on initial remainder value

**Result**: Transfer appreciating assets with minimal gift tax

#### Valuation Discount

**Discount Factors**:
- **Annuity Payments**: Reduce gift value
- **IRS Discount Rate**: Lower rate = higher discount
- **Term Length**: Longer term = higher discount
- **Asset Type**: Some assets get valuation discounts

**Example**:
- Asset Value: $1,000,000
- Annuity: $50,000/year for 10 years
- Discount Rate: 5%
- **Remainder Value**: ~$386,000
- **Gift Tax**: On $386,000, not $1,000,000
- **Savings**: Gift tax on $614,000 avoided

### Annuity Payment Calculations

#### Annuity Structure

**Payment Amount**: Based on IRS discount rate and term

**Payment Frequency**: Annual (typically)

**Payment Term**: 2-10 years (typically)

**Calculation**:
- Use IRS discount rate (monthly)
- Calculate present value of annuity
- Remainder = Asset Value - Annuity Present Value
- Gift = Remainder Value

#### IRS Discount Rate

**Current Rate**: Changes monthly (check IRS)

**Impact**: Lower rate = higher discount = lower gift tax

**Strategy**: 
- Create GRAT when rate is low
- Lock in favorable rate
- Maximize discount

### Asset Selection for Funding

#### Best Assets for GRATs

**Appreciating Assets**:
- Business interests (expected to grow)
- Real estate (expected to appreciate)
- Stocks (expected to grow)
- Other appreciating assets

**Assets to Avoid**:
- Cash (no appreciation)
- Depreciating assets
- Assets with uncertain value
- Illiquid assets (may need for annuity)

#### Business Interest GRATs

**Strategy**: Contribute business interests to GRAT

**Benefits**:
- Business grows in GRAT
- Growth passes to beneficiaries
- Gift tax only on current value
- Valuation discounts possible

**Example**:
- Business Interest: $500,000 (current value)
- Expected Growth: 15%/year
- GRAT Term: 5 years
- **Value in 5 Years**: ~$1,000,000
- **Gift Tax**: On ~$200,000 remainder (not $1,000,000)
- **Savings**: Significant

### Rolling GRAT Strategies

#### Rolling GRAT Concept

**Strategy**: Create new GRATs annually with remaining assets

**Process**:
1. Create GRAT Year 1
2. Assets appreciate
3. Annuity payments made
4. Remaining assets (if any) used for GRAT Year 2
5. Repeat annually

**Benefits**:
- Continues wealth transfer
- Uses annual exclusion
- Maximizes tax benefits
- Ongoing strategy

#### Implementation

**Year 1**:
- Create GRAT with $X
- Assets appreciate
- Annuity payments made
- Remaining assets: $Y

**Year 2**:
- Create new GRAT with $Y (plus new assets)
- Continue process
- Build wealth transfer

**Ongoing**:
- Continue annually
- Transfer wealth efficiently
- Minimize gift tax
- Support beneficiaries
