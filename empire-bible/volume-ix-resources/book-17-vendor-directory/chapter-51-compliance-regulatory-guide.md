# Chapter 51: Compliance & Regulatory Guide

## Introduction

Compliance is not a burden; it is a competitive advantage. In a world of sloppy operators, the Dynasty Empire stands out by being bulletproof. This chapter provides the framework for maintaining good standing with all governing bodies.

We operate on a "Zero Defect" policy regarding compliance. We do not cut corners on taxes, safety, or licensing. We sleep well at night because our paperwork is in order.
