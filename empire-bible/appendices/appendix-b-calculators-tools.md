## B.1 ROI Calculator (Return on Investment)

### Purpose
To evaluate the efficiency of an investment or compare the efficiency of a number of different investments.

### Formula
$$ ROI = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Total Investment}} \times 100 $$

### Inputs
- **Total Revenue:** Total income generated by the investment.
- **Total Cost:** All costs associated with the investment (marketing, labor, software, etc.).
- **Time Period:** The duration of the investment.

### Example (Marketing Campaign)
- **Revenue:** $50,000
- **Cost:** $10,000 (Ad spend) + $5,000 (Agency fee) = $15,000
- **Net Profit:** $35,000
- **ROI:** ($35,000 / $15,000) * 100 = **233%**

## B.2 Tax Estimator (Safe Harbor)

### Purpose
To estimate quarterly tax payments to avoid underpayment penalties, based on the "Safe Harbor" rule.

### Logic
You must pay the **smaller** of:
1.  90% of the tax shown on your current year's return, OR
2.  100% of the tax shown on your prior year's return (110% if AGI > $150k).

### Worksheet
1.  **Prior Year Total Tax:** $__________ (Line 24 on Form 1040)
2.  **Safe Harbor Target (110%):** Line 1 x 1.1 = $__________
3.  **Quarterly Payment Target:** Line 2 / 4 = $__________
4.  **Current Quarter Withholding:** $__________ (W-2 withholding, if any)
5.  **Estimated Payment Due:** Line 3 - Line 4 = $__________

5.  **Estimated Value:** = $__________

### EBITDA Multiple
*Used for larger businesses (>$5M revenue).*

**Formula:**
$$ \text{Value} = \text{EBITDA} \times \text{Multiple} $$
