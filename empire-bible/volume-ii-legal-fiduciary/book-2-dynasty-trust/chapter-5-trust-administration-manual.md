## Section 5.3: Investment Policy Statement

An Investment Policy Statement (IPS) guides trust investment decisions and ensures investments align with trust goals. This section covers asset allocation frameworks, rebalancing triggers, prohibited investments, and performance benchmarks.

### Asset Allocation Framework

Asset allocation is the foundation of investment management. This section covers allocation targets, risk tolerance, and time horizon considerations.

#### Allocation Targets

**Conservative Allocation** (Lower Risk):
- **Stocks**: 30-40%
- **Bonds**: 50-60%
- **Alternatives**: 10-20%
- **Cash**: 5-10%

**Moderate Allocation** (Moderate Risk):
- **Stocks**: 50-60%
- **Bonds**: 30-40%
- **Alternatives**: 10-20%
- **Cash**: 5-10%

**Aggressive Allocation** (Higher Risk):
- **Stocks**: 70-80%
- **Bonds**: 10-20%
- **Alternatives**: 10-20%
- **Cash**: 5-10%

**Legacy Codex Trust Allocation** (Moderate-Aggressive):
- **Stocks**: 60%
- **Bonds**: 25%
- **Real Estate**: 10%
- **Alternatives**: 5%

**Allocation Considerations**:

- Trust purpose
- Beneficiary needs
- Time horizon
- Risk tolerance
- Market conditions

#### Risk Tolerance

**Risk Factors**:

1. **Time Horizon**
   - Longer horizon = higher risk tolerance
   - Shorter horizon = lower risk tolerance
   - Perpetual trust = high risk tolerance

2. **Beneficiary Needs**
   - Current needs = lower risk
   - Future needs = higher risk
   - Growth needs = higher risk

3. **Trust Purpose**
   - Preservation = lower risk
   - Growth = higher risk
   - Balance = moderate risk

**Risk Tolerance Assessment**:

- **Low Risk**: Preservation focus, current needs
- **Moderate Risk**: Balance preservation and growth
- **High Risk**: Growth focus, long-term horizon

**Legacy Codex Trust Risk Tolerance**: Moderate-High (perpetual trust, growth focus)

#### Time Horizon Considerations

**Perpetual Trust Considerations**:

- **Very Long Horizon**: 365+ years
- **High Risk Tolerance**: Can accept volatility
- **Growth Focus**: Long-term growth important
- **Diversification**: Critical for long-term success

**Allocation Adjustments**:

- **Short-Term**: More conservative
- **Medium-Term**: Moderate allocation
- **Long-Term**: More aggressive
- **Perpetual**: Balanced aggressive allocation

**Best Practices**:
- Consider perpetual nature
- Focus on long-term growth
- Maintain diversification
- Review periodically
- Adjust as needed

### Rebalancing Triggers and Procedures
