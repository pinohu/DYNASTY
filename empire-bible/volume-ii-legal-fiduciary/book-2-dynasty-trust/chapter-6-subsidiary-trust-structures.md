# Chapter 6: Subsidiary Trust Structures

## Introduction

While the South Dakota Dynasty Trust serves as the foundation of your wealth preservation strategy, subsidiary trust structures provide specialized benefits for specific purposes. This chapter covers four critical subsidiary trusts: Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts (ILITs), Children's Crummey Trusts, Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs), and Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs).

Each of these trusts serves a specific purpose in your overall estate planning strategy. The ILIT removes life insurance from your estate, Children's Crummey Trusts facilitate annual exclusion gifting, CRTs provide charitable giving with income benefits, and GRATs transfer appreciating assets with minimal gift tax.

For the The Legacy Codex, these subsidiary trusts work together with the Dynasty Trust to create a comprehensive wealth preservation and transfer strategy. Understanding how to form, fund, and administer each trust is essential for maximizing their benefits.

## Section 6.4: Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)

A GRAT transfers appreciating assets to beneficiaries with minimal gift tax. This section covers valuation discount strategies, annuity payment calculations, asset selection, and rolling GRAT strategies.

### Valuation Discount Strategies

Valuation discounts reduce the gift tax value of transferred assets. This section covers discount opportunities, valuation methods, and examples.

#### Discount Opportunities

**1. Lack of Marketability Discount**

**Discount**: 20-30% typical

**Applies To**:
- Closely held businesses
- Limited partnership interests
- Other illiquid assets

**Rationale**: Assets lack ready market, reducing value.

**2. Lack of Control Discount**

**Discount**: 10-20% typical

**Applies To**:
- Minority interests
- Non-controlling interests
- Limited partnership interests

**Rationale**: Lack of control reduces value.

**3. Combined Discounts**

**Total Discount**: 30-50% possible

**Applies To**:
- Closely held business interests
- Limited partnership interests
- Other illiquid, non-controlling interests

**Rationale**: Combined discounts reflect multiple factors.

#### Valuation Methods

**Method 1: Income Approach**

**Process**:
- Project future income
- Discount to present value
- Apply discounts

**Use**: For income-generating assets.

**Method 2: Market Approach**

**Process**:
- Compare to similar assets
- Adjust for differences
- Apply discounts

**Use**: For assets with comparable sales.

**Method 3: Asset Approach**

**Process**:
- Value underlying assets
- Apply discounts
- Determine value

**Use**: For asset-holding entities.

**Recommendation**: Use professional appraiser for valuations.

#### Examples

**Scenario**:
- **Business Value**: $2,000,000
- **Interest Transferred**: 50%
- **Pro Rata Value**: $1,000,000
- **Lack of Marketability**: 25%
- **Lack of Control**: 15%
- **Combined Discount**: 36.25%

**Calculation**:
- **Discounted Value**: $637,500

- **Gift Tax Savings**: $362,500 (vs. pro rata value)

**Tax Benefits**:
- **Reduced Gift Tax**: Lower gift tax
- **Estate Tax Savings**: Removes appreciation from estate
- **Tax Efficiency**: Maximum tax efficiency

### Annuity Payment Calculations

Annuity payment calculations determine GRAT annuity payments. This section covers calculation methods, examples, and optimization strategies.

#### Calculation Methods

**Method 1: Fixed Annuity**

**Formula**:
- **Annuity Payment** = Fixed amount annually
- **Payment Amount** = Determined at GRAT creation
- **Payment Term** = GRAT term

**Example**:
- **GRAT Value**: $1,000,000
- **Annuity Rate**: 5%
- **Annuity Payment**: $50,000/year
- **Term**: 10 years

**Method 2: Percentage Annuity**

**Formula**:
- **Annuity Payment** = Percentage of initial value
- **Payment Amount** = Percentage × Initial value
- **Payment Term** = GRAT term

**Example**:
- **GRAT Value**: $1,000,000
- **Annuity Rate**: 5%
- **Annuity Payment**: $50,000/year (5% of $1M)
- **Term**: 10 years

#### Examples

**Example 1: Successful GRAT**

**Scenario**:
- **Initial Value**: $1,000,000
- **Annuity Rate**: 5% (IRS rate)
- **Annuity Payment**: $50,000/year
- **Term**: 10 years
- **Asset Growth**: 10% annually
- **Final Value**: $2,593,742

**Results**:
- **Annuity Payments**: $500,000 total
- **Remainder Value**: $2,093,742
- **Gift Tax Value**: $0 (zeroed-out GRAT)
- **Estate Tax Savings**: $837,497 (40% of remainder)

**Example 2: Zeroed-Out GRAT**

**Scenario**:
- **Initial Value**: $1,000,000
- **Annuity Rate**: 5.2% (IRS rate)
- **Annuity Payment**: $52,000/year
- **Term**: 10 years
- **Gift Tax Value**: $0

**Results**:
- **Zero Gift Tax**: No gift tax due
