## Template 5: Objection Handling - Price

**Subject:** Addressing Your Questions About Investment - {{company_name}}

**Body:**
```
Hi {{contact.first_name}},

I understand that {{objection}} is an important consideration. Let me address that directly.

I want to make sure we're comparing apples to apples. When evaluating the investment, consider:

1. **Value vs. Cost:** The real question isn't the cost, but the value you'll receive. Our solution will help you {{key_benefit}}, which typically results in {{quantified_result}}.

2. **ROI Timeline:** Most clients see a positive return within {{roi_timeline}}. Here's a breakdown:
   - Month 1-3: {{early_results}}
   - Month 4-6: {{mid_results}}
   - Month 7-12: {{full_results}}

3. **Cost of Inaction:** What's the cost of not solving this problem? Based on our discussion, you mentioned {{cost_of_inaction}}.

4. **Payment Options:** We offer flexible payment options:
   - Option 1: {{payment_option_1}}
   - Option 2: {{payment_option_2}}
   - Option 3: {{payment_option_3}}

I'd love to discuss this further. Would you be open to a brief call to explore options that work for your budget?
