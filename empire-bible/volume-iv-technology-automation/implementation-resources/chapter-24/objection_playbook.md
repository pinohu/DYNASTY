# Objection Handling Playbook

## The Framework: L.A.R.C.
1.  **Listen**: Hear them out completely. Don't interrupt.
2.  **Acknowledge**: Validate their concern ("I understand why you'd say that").
3.  **Reframe**: Pivot the perspective to value or solution.
4.  **Close**: Ask for agreement or move to the next step.

## Common Objections

### 1. "It's Too Expensive"
**Root Cause:** Value isn't clear, or budget is truly tight.

**Response:**
"I understand cost is an important consideration. Let's look at the value you'll receive.

Based on [specific benefit], you'll save approximately $[amount] per [time period]. Over [timeframe], that's $[total] in value.

Compared to [alternative solution], this actually represents [better value proposition].

We also have different service tiers to fit different budgets. Would you like to explore those options?"

### 2. "I Need to Think About It"
**Root Cause:** Uncertainty, hidden objection, or stalling.

**Response:**
"I appreciate you want to think it through. That's completely understandable.

What specifically would you like to think about? Is it the investment, the timeline, or something else?

I understand your need to consider this, but given [urgency factor], I want to make sure you have all the information you need.

How about we schedule a brief call next week to answer any questions? When would work for you?"

### 3. "I'm Not Sure This Is Right for Us"
**Root Cause:** Trust gap or fit concern.

**Response:**
"I appreciate your honesty. What specifically concerns you about our solution?

[Address specific concern]

I understand. Many of our clients had similar concerns initially. Here's what happened with [similar client]...

[Share relevant case study]

How about we [offer trial period/guarantee/demo] so you can see for yourself? Would that help address your concern?"

### 4. "We're Already Working with Someone"
**Root Cause:** Loyalty or inertia.

**Response:**
"I understand you have an existing relationship. That's great that you have a solution in place.

Here's how we're different from [current provider]:
*   [Differentiator 1]
*   [Differentiator 2]
*   [Differentiator 3]

I'd love to stay in touch and be a resource for you. When might be a good time to revisit this, or would you like me to check in periodically?"
