**Assign to Agent 12:**
- Appendices A-D (Quick Reference Guides, Calculators, Contact Lists, Glossary)
- Document Specifications Section
- Access Levels Section
- Digital Supplements (specification and structure)

**Rationale**: Agent 12 is responsible for compilation and final document structure. These appendices and front matter sections are part of the master document compilation process.

### **Agent 11 (Template Specialist)** - SUPPORTING ASSIGNMENT
**Assign to Agent 11:**
- Appendix B calculators (actual calculator templates/tools)
- Appendix A checklists (if not already created by volume writers)

**Rationale**: Agent 11 creates templates and tools, so calculator templates and checklist templates fall under their scope.

### **Agent 13 (Cross-Reference Manager)** - SUPPORTING ASSIGNMENT
**Assign to Agent 13:**
- Appendix C Contact Lists (extract contacts from all chapters)
- Appendix D Glossary (extract terms from all chapters)

**Rationale**: Agent 13 already extracts and organizes content (indexes), so extracting contacts and terms for appendices aligns with their role.
