# ⚠️ ARCHIVE / REFERENCE ONLY

**This directory contains legacy materials, templates, and previous drafts.**

## ⛔ Do Not Edit for Production

The active, production-ready manuscripts are located in the **`../manuscripts/`** folder in the root directory.

## Purpose of this Folder

You may use this folder to:
1.  Copy **Checklists** or **Templates** that haven't been integrated into the main text yet.
2.  Reference historical versions of the strategy.
3.  Access specific raw templates (e.g., "Meeting Minutes," "SOPs") referenced in the main Codex.

If you find a valuable template here that belongs in the Master Codex, **copy its content into the appropriate manuscript in `../manuscripts/`**.
