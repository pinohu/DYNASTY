# Chapter 49: Professional Service Providers

## Introduction

No Empire is built alone. We rely on a network of vetted, high-competence professionals to handle the specialized tasks of law, finance, and real estate. This chapter serves as the "Rolodex" for the Ohu Family Enterprise.

It defines the **Selection Criteria** (how to hire), the **Engagement Model** (how to manage), and the **Performance Standards** (how to fire) for every external partner. We do not treat these providers as vendors; we treat them as extensions of our executive team.

**Critical Framework**: All professional service providers are evaluated using a standardized framework that includes selection criteria, engagement models, performance standards, and regular reviews. This ensures we work with the best professionals who align with our values and deliver exceptional results.

#### Cost Analysis Framework

- Time investment
- Opportunity costs
- Risk costs

**Example: Trust Company TCO Analysis**

**Company A (Percentage-Based)**:
- Annual fee: 0.25% of $10M = $25,000
- Additional charges: $2,000
- Time investment: 20 hours/year @ $200/hour = $4,000

**Company B (Flat Fee)**:
- Annual fee: $15,000 flat
- Additional charges: $1,000
- Time investment: 15 hours/year @ $200/hour = $3,000
- **Total Year 1**: $19,000

**5-Year Projection** (assuming assets grow to $20M):
- Company A: $25,000 + $2,000 + $4,000 = $31,000/year â†’ $155,000 total
- Company B: $15,000 + $1,000 + $3,000 = $19,000/year â†’ $95,000 total
