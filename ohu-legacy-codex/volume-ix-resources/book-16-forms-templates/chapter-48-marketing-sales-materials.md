## 48.2 Sales Scripts

Sales scripts provide standardized, proven language for every stage of the sales process. These scripts are designed to be natural, conversational, and effective while maintaining consistency across the sales team.

### 48.2.1 Cold Outreach

**The "Pattern Interrupt"**

**Purpose**: Break through the noise and get prospects' attention with an unexpected opening that creates curiosity and engagement.

**Phone Script - Pattern Interrupt**:

**Opening**:
"Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm not sure if you're the right person, but we help [Industry] businesses solve [Problem]. Are you open to a 30-second pitch, or should I hang up?"

**If Yes**:
"Great! [Problem] is costing businesses like yours [Cost/Impact]. We help them [Solution/Benefit]. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in learning more about?"

**If No**:
"No problem. Who would be the right person to talk to about [Problem]?"

**Full Phone Script**:

```
[Opening - Pattern Interrupt]
"Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm not sure if you're the right person, but we help [Industry] businesses solve [Problem]. Are you open to a 30-second pitch, or should I hang up?"

[If Yes - Continue]
"Great! Here's the thing: [Problem] is costing businesses like yours [Quantified Impact]. For example, [Specific Example]. 

We help them [Solution] which typically [Benefit/Result]. 

Does that sound like something that might be relevant to [Company Name]?"

[If Interested - Discovery]
"That's great! I'd love to learn more about your situation. Do you have 5 minutes now, or would [Alternative Time] work better?"

[If Not Interested - Exit Gracefully]
"I understand. Thanks for your time. If things change, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!"

[If Wrong Person - Get Referral]
"No problem. Who would be the right person to talk to about [Problem]? And what's the best way to reach them?"
```

**Email Script - Pattern Interrupt**:

**Subject Line Options**:
- "Question about [Company Name]"
- "[Company Name] - Quick question"
- "Is [Problem] costing you money?"
- "30 seconds to save [Amount]?"

**Email Body Template**:

```
Subject: Question about [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is in the [Industry] business. 

Quick question: Is [Problem] something you're dealing with?

If so, we help businesses like yours [Solution/Benefit]. 

For example, we recently helped [Similar Company] [Specific Result].

Worth a 15-minute chat to see if we can help you too?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Company]
[Phone]
[Email]

### 48.2.2 Discovery Call

**The "Doctor Frame"**

**Purpose**: Diagnose the prospect's situation before prescribing a solution. Ask questions to understand their pain points, goals, budget, timeline, and decision-making process.

**Core Principle**: We diagnose before we prescribe. Just like a doctor, we need to understand the symptoms before recommending treatment.

**Discovery Call Structure**:

**Opening (2 minutes)**:
- Thank them for their time
- Set agenda: "I'd like to learn about your situation and see if we can help"
- Confirm time available
- Ask permission to ask questions

**Discovery Questions (15-20 minutes)**:

**Urgency Questions**:
- "What prompted you to look into this *now*?"
- "What changed recently that made this a priority?"
- "What's the timeline you're working with?"

**Pain Questions**:
- "What happens if you *don't* fix this problem?"
- "How is this problem affecting your business right now?"
- "What's the cost of the current situation?"
- "What have you tried so far?"

**Vision Questions**:
- "If we could wave a magic wand, what would the perfect solution look like?"
- "What would success look like for you?"
- "What's your ideal outcome?"

**Budget Questions**:
- "What kind of investment are you considering?"
- "What's your budget range?"
- "How do you typically make these kinds of decisions?"

**Decision-Making Questions**:
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"
- "What's your decision-making process?"
- "What would need to happen for you to move forward?"

**Full Discovery Call Script**:

```
[Opening]
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time to talk with me today. I'm [Your Name] from [Company].

The purpose of this call is for me to learn about your situation and see if we might be a good fit to help. Does that work for you?

Great! I have about [X] minutes. Is that still good on your end?"

[Discovery - Urgency]
"Perfect. Let's start with understanding what's going on. What prompted you to look into this *now*?"

[Discovery - Pain]
"That makes sense. So help me understand: What happens if you *don't* fix this problem?"

"How is this problem affecting your business right now?"

"What's the cost of the current situation?"

[Discovery - Vision]
"Got it. Now, if we could wave a magic wand, what would the perfect solution look like?"

"What would success look like for you?"

[Discovery - Budget]
"Understood. What kind of investment are you considering for this?"

[Discovery - Decision-Making]
"Who else is involved in this decision?"

"What's your decision-making process?"

[Summary & Next Steps]
"Based on what you've told me, it sounds like [Summary of their situation].

Would it make sense to put together a proposal for you to review?"

[If Yes]
"Great! I'll put together a proposal and send it to you by [Timeline]. When would be a good time to follow up?"

```

### 48.2.3 Objection Handling

**The "Feel, Felt, Found" Framework**

**Purpose**: Handle objections in a way that acknowledges the prospect's concern, provides social proof, and reframes the objection as an opportunity.

**Objection Handling Framework**:
1. **Feel**: Acknowledge their concern ("I understand how you feel")
2. **Felt**: Provide social proof ("Many of our best clients felt the same way")
3. **Found**: Share the outcome ("But what they found was...")

**Common Objections & Responses**:

**Price Objection**:

**Response 1 - Feel, Felt, Found**:
"I understand how you feel. Many of our best clients felt the same way initially. But what they found was that the cost of *inaction* was 10x higher than the investment in our solution.

For example, [Client Name] was hesitant about the investment, but after working with us, they saved [Amount] in [Timeframe]. The ROI was [X]%.

Would it help if I showed you how we can structure the payment to fit your budget?"

**Response 2 - Reframe as Investment**:
"I hear you. Let me reframe this: This isn't a cost, it's an investment. 

The question isn't 'Can you afford this?' The question is 'Can you afford NOT to fix this problem?'

Based on what you told me, [Problem] is costing you [Amount] per [Timeframe]. Our solution costs [Amount] and will save you [Amount] per [Timeframe]. That's a [X]% return on investment.

Does that change how you think about it?"

**Timing Objection**:

**Response**:
"I understand. Let me ask you this: Is the problem going to get better or worse by waiting?

Based on what you told me, [Problem] is [Getting worse/Costing more]. If we wait [Timeframe], it will likely cost [More/Impact].

We can start as early as [Date]. What would need to happen for you to move forward now?"

**Competitor Objection**:

**Response**:
"That's great that you're considering other options. That shows you're doing your due diligence.

What I'd suggest is: Compare apples to apples. When you look at [Our Unique Differentiator], we're the only ones who offer [Specific Benefit].

For example, [Client Name] was comparing us to [Competitor]. They chose us because [Reason]. 

Would it help if I showed you a side-by-side comparison?"

**Authority Objection**:

**Response**:
"I understand you need to discuss this with [Decision Maker]. 

What I'd suggest is: Let me put together a proposal that you can share with them. It will include [Key Points] that address their concerns.

When would be a good time to follow up after they've reviewed it?"

**Full Objection Handling Script**:

```
[Objection Received]
"I understand how you feel about [Objection]. Many of our best clients felt the same way initially.

But what they found was [Benefit/Outcome].

For example, [Client Name] had the same concern. After working with us, they [Result].

[Reframe or Provide Alternative]
[Address the objection directly]

Does that help address your concern?"
```

**Objection Handling Best Practices**:
- Listen fully before responding
- Acknowledge their concern
- Use social proof
- Reframe when possible
- Provide alternatives
- Don't be defensive
- Ask if concern is resolved

**Objection Handling Implementation Checklist**:

- [ ] Refine based on results

### 48.2.4 Closing

**The "Assumptive Close"**

**Purpose**: Assume the sale and move forward with next steps. Use assumptive language that implies the prospect has already decided to move forward.

**Closing Techniques**:

**Assumptive Close**:
"Based on what you've told me, our [Package X] is the perfect fit. Shall we get the paperwork started so we can schedule the kickoff for next Tuesday?"

**Alternative Choice Close**:
"Great! We have two options: [Option A] or [Option B]. Which one works better for you?"

**Summary Close**:
"Let me summarize what we've discussed: [Summary]. Based on that, it sounds like [Package X] is the right fit. Shall we move forward?"

**Urgency Close**:
"I want to make sure we can get you started by [Date]. To do that, we'd need to get the paperwork done by [Earlier Date]. Can we make that happen?"

**Full Closing Script**:

```
[After Discovery and Addressing Objections]

"Based on everything we've discussed, it sounds like [Package X] is the perfect fit for what you need.

Here's what I'm thinking:
â€¢ [Benefit 1]
â€¢ [Benefit 2]
â€¢ [Benefit 3]

This will help you [Achieve Goal] and [Solve Problem].

Does that sound right?"

[If Yes]
"Perfect! Here's what happens next:
1. I'll send you the proposal
2. You review and sign
3. We schedule the kickoff for [Date]
