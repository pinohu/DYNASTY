# Chapter 18: Property Management Systems

## Introduction

Acquiring property is the fun part; managing it is the work. Property management is where the money is actually made (or lost). A poorly managed asset will bleed cash, attract lawsuits, and destroy your REPS hours with low-value "firefighting" tasks.

For Obuke LLC, the goal is to build a management system that is scalable, compliant, and efficient. Whether you are self-managing to hit your REPS hours or managing a third-party manager to scale, you need a system. This chapter outlines the protocols for tenant screening, maintenance, rent collection, and portfolio optimization.

## Section 18.1: Self-Management Operations

Self-management is often necessary in the early stages to maximize cash flow and accumulate REPS hours.

### Tenant Screening Systems

**The "Gatekeeper"**:
- **Criteria**: Set objective criteria *before* you market.
    -   Income: 3x monthly rent (Gross).
    -   Credit: 600+ (Flexible if income is high).
    -   Evictions: Zero in last 5 years.
    -   Criminal: No violent felonies.
- **Process**:
    1.  **Pre-Screen**: Ask questions before the showing. "When are you looking to move? Do you have pets?"
    2.  **Application**: Online only (TurboTenant, Zillow, Apartments.com).
    3.  **Background Check**: Verify everything. Call the *previous* landlord (not the current one, who might be lying to get rid of them).

### Lease Agreements

**The "Rulebook"**:
- Do not use a generic Office Depot lease. Use a state-specific lease drafted by a landlord attorney.
- **Key Clauses**:
    -   **Joint and Several Liability**: Everyone is responsible for the full rent.
    -   **No Subletting/Airbnb**: Unless explicitly allowed.
    -   **Maintenance Deductible**: "Tenant pays first $50 of repairs" (Reduces nuisance calls).
    -   **Waiver of Notice**: (If legal in your state) speeds up eviction.

### Maintenance Protocols

**The "System"**:
- **Reporting**: Tenants must submit requests via portal (SuiteDash or PM software). No texts.
- **Triage**: Is it an emergency? (Fire, Flood, Blood). If not, schedule it.
- **Vendors**: Build a "Preferred Vendor List."
    -   Handyman ($50/hr).
    -   Plumber ($100/hr).
    -   HVAC ($100/hr).
- **Approval Limit**: Give vendors a "Not to Exceed" limit (e.g., $200) so they can fix small things without calling you.

### Rent Collection

**The "No Cash" Policy**:
- **Online Only**: ACH or Credit Card via portal.
- **Auto-Pay**: Incentivize it. "Sign up for Auto-Pay and we waive the setup fee."
- **Late Fees**: Enforce them automatically. "The computer charges the fee, I can't change it."

### Eviction Procedures

**The "Nuclear Option"**:
- **Cash for Keys**: Always try this first. "I will give you $500 and your full deposit back if you are out by Friday, broom clean."
- **Legal Process**:
    1.  **Notice to Quit**: Post it the day rent is late.
    2.  **File Complaint**: District Justice / Magistrate.
    3.  **Hearing**: Show up with the lease and the rent ledger.
    4.  **Possession**: Sheriff lockout.

## Section 18.2: Property Management Transition

Eventually, you will want to scale beyond what you can self-manage.

### When to Outsource

**The "Trigger Points"**:
- **Geography**: Property is > 1 hour away.
- **Volume**: You have > 20 units.
- **Time**: You are spending > 10 hours/week on low-value tasks (and you already have your REPS hours).

### Company Selection

**The "Interview"**:
- "How many units do you manage?" (Too few = inexperienced; Too many = you're a number).
- "What is your vacancy rate?"
- "What is your average eviction rate?"
- "Do you markup maintenance?" (Common profit center for PMs).

### Contract Negotiation

**The "Terms"**:
- **Management Fee**: 8-10% of *collected* rent. (Never pay on gross potential).
- **Leasing Fee**: 50-100% of first month's rent.
- **Renewal Fee**: Flat fee ($250) or small %.
- **Termination**: Ensure you can cancel with 30 days' notice.

### Performance Monitoring

**The "Manager" of the Manager**:
- **Weekly Report**: Vacancy update, maintenance summary.
- **Monthly Report**: P&L, Rent Roll.
- **Quarterly Call**: Strategy review.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**The "Math"**:
- **Cost**: 10% Management Fee + Leasing Fees.
- **Benefit**: Time saved + Professional systems + potentially higher rents.
- **Decision**: If you can earn more per hour doing *deals* than you save doing *management*, outsource.

## Section 18.3: Portfolio Optimization

Maximizing the value of what you own.

### Performance Metrics

**KPIs**:
- **NOI (Net Operating Income)**: Income - Expenses (before debt service).
- **Cash on Cash Return**: Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested.
- **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)**: NOI / Debt Payment. (Target 1.25+).
- **Expense Ratio**: Expenses / Income. (Target < 40-50%).

### Improvement Priorities

**The "ROI" Renovations**:
- **Kitchens & Baths**: Highest return.
- **Flooring**: LVP (Luxury Vinyl Plank) everywhere. Durable, looks high-end.
- **Paint**: Fresh "Greige" (Gray/Beige).
- **Curb Appeal**: Landscaping, house numbers, mailbox.

### Refinancing Triggers

**The "BRRRR" End Game**:
- **Equity**: When you have > 25-30% equity.
- **Rates**: When rates drop or you can improve cash flow.
- **Cash Out**: Pull tax-free cash to buy the next deal.

### Disposition Criteria

**The "Cull"**:
- **ROE (Return on Equity)**: If a property has $100k equity but only cash flows $200/mo, your ROE is terrible (2.4%).
- **Action**: Sell (1031 Exchange) into a larger asset that works harder.

### 1031 Opportunities

**The "Trade Up"**:
- Move from Single Family -> Multi-Family.
- Move from C-Class -> B-Class.
- Move from High Maintenance -> Low Maintenance.

## Section 18.4: Multi-State Expansion

Going national.

### Market Selection

**The "Data" Approach**:
- **Population Growth**: Is the city growing?
- **Job Growth**: Are employers moving there?
- **Landlord Laws**: Is it landlord-friendly? (Red states usually better than Blue states).
- **Price-to-Rent Ratio**: Can you actually cash flow?

### Legal Requirements

**Foreign Qualification**:
- You must register your Wyoming LLC as a "Foreign Entity" in the state where the property is located.
- **Registered Agent**: Need one in that state.

### Management Strategies

**The "Boots on the Ground"**:
- You need a "Core 4" in every market:
    1.  Deal Finder (Wholesaler/Agent).
    2.  Property Manager.
    3.  Contractor.
    4.  Lender.

### Tax Implications

**State Taxes**:
- You will file a non-resident tax return in every state where you own property.
- **Cost**: Factor in extra accounting fees.

### Exit Planning

**The "Portfolio Sale"**:
- It is harder to sell a scattered portfolio.
- **Strategy**: Try to cluster assets. 10 houses in one city is worth more than 1 house in 10 cities (operational efficiency).

## Section 18.5: Operational Scenarios (War Stories)

Management is about handling exceptions. Here is how Obuke LLC handles common crises.

### Scenario A: The Midnight Emergency

**Situation**: At 2:00 AM on a Tuesday, a tenant calls: "Water is pouring through the ceiling!"

**The Wrong Way**: You panic, drive over there yourself, and try to fix it with duct tape.
**The Obuke Way**:
1.  **Tenant Action**: Tenant is instructed (by lease) to shut off the main water valve immediately. (Show them where this is at move-in).
2.  **Triage**: Does water stop? Yes. Is life in danger? No.
3.  **Dispatch**: You text/call your 24/7 Plumber (from your Vendor List).
4.  **Resolution**: Plumber arrives at 8 AM (emergency rates avoided if water is off).
5.  **Cost**: Plumber bills you $300.
6.  **Result**: You slept through the night (mostly).

### Scenario B: The Late Payer

**Situation**: Rent is due on the 1st. It is the 6th, and no payment has arrived.

**The Wrong Way**: You text the tenant: "Hey, just checking in on rent?" (Weakness).
**The Obuke Way**:
1.  **Day 1**: Automated email reminder.
2.  **Day 5 (Grace Period Ends)**: System automatically adds $50 late fee.
3.  **Day 6**: "Pay or Quit" Notice is posted on the door. (This is a legal requirement, not a personal attack).
4.  **Tenant Call**: "I get paid on Friday!"
5.  **Your Response**: "That's fine. The late fee is already applied. As long as full payment (Rent + Late Fee) is in by Friday, we won't file for eviction. If not, the filing goes out Monday."
6.  **Result**: Tenant prioritizes your rent over their cable bill.

### Example: Tenant Screening Matrix

How to make objective decisions without emotion.

| Criteria | Standard | Applicant A | Applicant B |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Income** | 3x Rent ($4,500) | $5,000 (Job) | $10,000 (Self-Employed) |
| **Credit** | 600+ | 620 | 550 |
| **Evictions** | 0 | 0 | 1 (Dismissed) |
| **Pets** | Max 1 | 1 Dog | 3 Cats |
| **Move-In** | Within 30 Days | Next Week | 2 Months |
| **Decision** | -- | **APPROVE** | **DENY** |

**Why?**
-   **Applicant A** meets all criteria. Lower income but stable.
-   **Applicant B** has higher income but risky credit, too many pets, and a history of landlord disputes (even if dismissed, it's a flag). Plus, waiting 2 months costs you $3,000 in vacancy.
