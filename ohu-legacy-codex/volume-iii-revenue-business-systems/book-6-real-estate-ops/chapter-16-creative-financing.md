# Chapter 16: Creative Financing Mastery

## Introduction

Real estate is the ultimate wealth preservation vehicle, but traditional financing (20% down, bank qualification) is a bottleneck. To build a Legacy-scale portfolio, you must master **Creative Financing**. This allows you to acquire assets based on the *deal's* merit, not just your personal credit or cash reserves.

For Obuke LLC, creative financing is the primary acquisition strategy. It allows for infinite returns (when acquisition cost is zero or low), rapid scaling, and solving problems for sellers that banks cannot touch. This chapter details the mechanics of Subject-To, Seller Financing, and Private Money—the "Trifecta" of creative acquisition.

## Section 16.1: Subject-To Acquisitions

"Subject-To" (SubTo) means buying a property *subject to* the existing mortgage staying in place. You take title, but the seller's loan remains.

### Legal Structures

**The Trust Model**:
- Never take title in your personal name.
- **Structure**: Seller deeds property to a **Land Trust**.
- **Beneficiary**: Your LLC (Obuke LLC) is the beneficiary of the trust.
- **Trustee**: A third-party trustee or your LLC.
- **Why**: This provides privacy and helps avoid the "Due-on-Sale" clause (Garn-St. Germain Act allows transfers to trusts).

### Documentation Requirements

**The "Kitchen Sink" Packet**:
1.  **Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA)**: Must explicitly state "Subject to existing financing."
2.  **Authorization to Release Information**: Allows you to talk to the lender.
3.  **Limited Power of Attorney**: Allows you to sign on behalf of the seller for insurance/tax matters related to the property.
4.  **"CYA" Disclosures**: Seller acknowledges that the loan stays in their name and their credit could be affected if you default. (Crucial for defense).
5.  **Deed**: Warranty Deed to Trustee.

### Due Diligence Checklist

**The "Deal Killer" Check**:
1.  **Arrears**: Is the loan current? If not, how much to reinstate?
2.  **Interest Rate**: Is it low enough to cash flow? (Sub 4-5% is gold).
3.  **Balloon Payments**: Is there a balloon payment due soon?
4.  **Liens**: Are there second mortgages, solar loans, or tax liens?
5.  **HOA**: Are dues current? Are there rental restrictions?

### Risk Mitigation

**The "Due-on-Sale" Defense**:
- **Insurance**: Do not just change the policy. Add the Trust as "Additional Insured" or use a specialized insurance carrier that understands SubTo.
- **Payments**: Use a third-party servicer (like Weststar) to pay the mortgage. This creates an official record of payments and comforts the seller.

### Exit Strategies

**Multiple Outs**:
1.  **Long-Term Rental**: Cash flow the spread.
2.  **Mid-Term Rental**: Furnished finder/Travel nurses (Higher cash flow).
3.  **Wrap**: Sell on a "Wraparound Mortgage" (Arbitrage the interest rate).

## Section 16.2: Owner Financing Strategies

Owner Financing (Seller Financing) is when the seller acts as the bank. They own the property free and clear (or with high equity) and agree to receive payments over time.

### Negotiation Tactics

**The "Price vs. Terms" Pivot**:
- "Mr. Seller, I can give you your price if you give me my terms. Or I can give you your terms (cash) if you give me my price."
- **Pain Points**: Focus on tax benefits. "If I pay you cash, you pay capital gains tax on the whole amount this year. If I pay you monthly, you spread that tax hit over years."

### Terms Optimization

**The "0% Interest" Play**:
- **Principal Only Payments**: "Instead of paying the bank interest, every dollar I pay goes into your pocket."
- **Balloon**: Push it out as far as possible (5-10 years minimum).
- **Down Payment**: "I can put down $10k now to cover your closing costs and moving expenses."

### Documentation

**The Note and Deed**:
- **Promissory Note**: Outlines the debt (Amount, Interest, Term, Payment).
- **Deed of Trust / Mortgage**: Secures the note against the property. Recorded at the county.
- **Why**: Protects the seller (they can foreclose if you don't pay) and protects you (you have title).

### Default Protection

**Grace Periods**:
- Negotiate a 15-30 day grace period before late fees.
- **Right to Cure**: Ensure you have the right to cure any default before foreclosure starts.

### Wraparound Mortgages

**The "Wrap"**:
- If there is an underlying mortgage, you can "wrap" it.
- You pay the seller a payment that covers their mortgage + their equity.
- **Risk**: Ensure the underlying mortgage is actually getting paid. (Use a servicer).

## Section 16.3: Private Money Raising

When you need cash for the down payment, renovations, or reinstatement fees, you turn to Private Money Lenders (PML).

### Investor Presentation

**The "Deal Deck"**:
- **Executive Summary**: The "Elevator Pitch."
- **The Property**: Photos, location, specs.
- **The Numbers**: Purchase price, rehab budget, ARV (After Repair Value), projected rent.
- **The Offer**: "Lending $50k at 10% interest, secured by 2nd lien, 12-month term."
- **The Exit**: How they get their money back.

### Legal Compliance

**SEC Rules**:
- **506(b)**: Can raise from unlimited accredited investors and up to 35 sophisticated investors. *Cannot advertise publicly.* (Relationship based).
- **506(c)**: Can advertise publicly. *Accredited investors only.*
- **Joint Venture**: Active partners (not passive investors). No SEC filing needed if they have control.

### Documentation Packages

**The "Security"**:
- **Promissory Note**: The IOU.
- **Deed of Trust / Mortgage**: The collateral.
- **Personal Guarantee**: (Optional, but builds trust with new lenders).
- **Insurance**: List lender as "Mortgagee" or "Loss Payee."

### Investor Relations

**Communication**:
- **Monthly Update**: "Project is on track. Here are photos."
- **Payment**: Automated ACH deposits. Never be late. "Early is on time."

### Performance Reporting

**The "Track Record"**:
- Keep a spreadsheet of every deal, every lender, and every return paid.
- Show this to new lenders: "I have borrowed $2M and paid back $2M + interest. Zero defaults."

## Section 16.4: Hybrid Strategies

Combining methods for maximum flexibility.

### Lease Options

**"Rent to Own"**:
- You lease the property with an *option* to buy at a set price.
- **Control without Ownership**: You control the property but don't take title yet.
- **Low Risk**: If the market crashes, you can walk away (losing only option fee).

### Contract for Deed

**"Land Contract"**:
- Seller keeps title until you pay off the loan.
- **Pros**: Easier to take back if buyer defaults (eviction vs. foreclosure).
- **Cons**: You don't have the deed, so you can't refinance or pull equity easily.

### Master Lease Agreements

**Commercial Strategy**:
- You lease an apartment building from the owner with the right to sublease.
- You pay the owner a fixed rent. You keep everything above that.
- **Value Add**: You improve management, raise rents, and keep the spread.

### Joint Ventures

**"Money Partner + Work Partner"**:
- You find the deal and manage it. Partner puts up the money.
- **Split**: 50/50 equity and cash flow.
- **Exit**: Refinance or sell to pay back partner.

### Syndications

**"Pooling Money"**:
- For large deals (50+ units).
- **GP (General Partner)**: You do the work.
- **LP (Limited Partner)**: Investors put up money.
- **Structure**: Complex, requires SEC attorney.

## Section 16.5: The "SubTo" Deal Example (Live Case Study)

To fully understand the power of Subject-To, let's walk through a concrete example with actual numbers. This scenario demonstrates how you can acquire a cash-flowing asset with minimal capital.

### The Situation (The Lead)

**Seller**: John Smith
**Reason for Selling**: Job transfer to another state. Needs to move in 30 days.
**Property**: 3 Bed / 2 Bath single-family home in a B-class neighborhood.
**Market Value**: $250,000 (if listed on MLS with an agent).
**Mortgage Balance**: $220,000.
**Interest Rate**: 3.25% (locked in 2021).
**Problem**: If John sells on MLS, he pays 6% agent fees ($15,000) + 2% closing costs ($5,000).
**Net to Seller**: $250k - $20k costs - $220k loan = $10k profit.
**Time**: MLS sales take 60-90 days. John needs to leave in 30.

### The Offer (The Solution)

You approach John as Obuke LLC and offer to take over his payments.

**The "SubTo" Proposal**:
1.  **Purchase Price**: $225,000 (We cover his loan balance + $5k cash to him).
2.  **Terms**: Subject-To existing mortgage.
3.  **Cash to Seller**: $5,000 moving money (solves his immediate need).
4.  **Closing Costs**: We pay all closing costs ($3,000).
5.  **Closing Date**: 14 days (solves his time constraint).

### The Acquisition Cost (Entry Fee)

How much cash do you need to close this deal?

-   **Cash to Seller**: $5,000
-   **Closing Costs**: $3,000 (Title, recording, attorney)
-   **Insurance Premium**: $1,000 (First year)
-   **Agent Commissions**: $0 (Direct to seller)
-   **Total Entry Fee**: **$9,000**

*Note: A traditional 20% down purchase of a $250k home would cost $50,000+.*

### The Numbers (Cash Flow Analysis)

Now, let's look at the monthly profitability.

**Expense (Mortgage Payment)**:
-   Principal & Interest: $957 (based on $220k @ 3.25%)
-   Taxes: $300/mo
-   Insurance: $100/mo
-   **Total PITI**: **$1,357/mo**

**Income (Rental)**:
-   Market Rent: **$2,100/mo**

**Cash Flow**:
-   Rent: $2,100
-   PITI: -$1,357
-   Vacancy/Maintenance (10%): -$210
-   **Net Cash Flow**: **$533/mo**

### Return on Investment (ROI)

-   **Annual Cash Flow**: $533 x 12 = $6,396
-   **Total Cash Invested**: $9,000
-   **Cash-on-Cash Return**: $6,396 / $9,000 = **71%**

### The Verdict

By using Subject-To, you:
1.  Solved John's problem (fast closing, no fees).
2.  Acquired a $250k asset for $9k out of pocket.
3.  Locked in a 3.25% interest rate in a high-rate environment.
4.  Achieved a 71% annual return (vs. 8-10% in the stock market).

This is why we use Creative Financing.
