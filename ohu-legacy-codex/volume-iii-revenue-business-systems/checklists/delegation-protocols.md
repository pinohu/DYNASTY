# Delegation Protocols: The Architect vs. The Bricklayer

## Introduction

This document defines the operational separation between **High-Value Strategy (The Architect)** and **Low-Value Execution (The Bricklayer)**. To scale the Polymath Empire, you must ruthlessly delegate the "Bricklayer" tasks.

**The Golden Rule**: You (The Polymath) only touch tasks that require your specific license, your strategic brain, or your face.
