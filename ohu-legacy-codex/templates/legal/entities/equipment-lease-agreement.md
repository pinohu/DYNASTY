## Purpose

This agreement is used when one entity (Lessor) owns equipment (computers, vehicles, machinery) and leases it to another entity (Lessee). This is common in asset protection strategies where valuable assets are held in a separate holding company to protect them from operating liabilities.

## Instructions

1.  **Describe Equipment**: Be specific (Serial numbers, models).
2.  **Set Rent**: Rent should be fair market value (FMV).
3.  **Responsibilities**: Define who pays for maintenance, insurance, and taxes (usually Lessee in a "Triple Net" style lease).
