# Cost Sharing Agreement Template

## Purpose

This agreement allows related entities to share the costs of services, facilities, or employees without charging a profit markup. It is commonly used when a management company (like CXI LLC) pays for shared resources (software, office space, admin staff) and allocates the cost to operating subsidiaries.

**IMPORTANT**: This is for *cost allocation*, not for profit-generating services. If the provider is adding value and charging a markup, use the **Master Services Agreement** instead.

## Instructions

1.  **Identify Services**: List the shared costs (e.g., rent, utilities, software subscriptions).
2.  **Allocation Method**: Define how costs are split (e.g., based on revenue, headcount, or usage).
3.  **Invoicing**: Specify how often the reimbursement occurs (usually monthly).
