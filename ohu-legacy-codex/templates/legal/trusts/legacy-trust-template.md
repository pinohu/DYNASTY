- **Tax Considerations**: The 365-year perpetuities period provides maximum flexibility but may have GST tax implications. Consult with tax advisors.

- **Trustee Selection**: Careful selection of independent trustees is critical for estate tax exclusion. The Administrative Trustee should be a South Dakota trust company.

- **Funding**: Initial funding should be completed promptly after execution. Consider funding with cash, marketable securities, or business interests.

- **Crummey Powers**: If annual exclusion gifts are made, ensure Crummey withdrawal rights are properly structured and notices are sent.

- **Annual Administration**: The Administrative Trustee will handle annual compliance, but Settlors should monitor to ensure proper administration.

- **Amendment Flexibility**: The Trust Protector has broad amendment powers, but cannot change charitable remainder provisions without court approval.
