## Risk Evaluation

### Probability Assessment

**Probability of Negative Outcome**: [1-10]
- 1-3: Low probability
- 4-6: Moderate probability
- 7-9: High probability
- 10: Very high probability

**Probability Rationale**: [Explanation of probability assessment]

### Impact Assessment

**Impact if Risk Materializes**: [1-10]
- 1-3: Low impact (minor inconvenience)
- 4-6: Moderate impact (significant but manageable)
- 7-9: High impact (major disruption)
- 10: Catastrophic impact (threatens empire survival)

**Impact Rationale**: [Explanation of impact assessment]

### Mitigability Assessment

**Ability to Reduce Probability or Impact**: [1-10]
- 1-3: Low mitigability (difficult to reduce)
- 4-6: Moderate mitigability (some reduction possible)
- 7-9: High mitigability (significant reduction possible)
- 10: Very high mitigability (can eliminate or nearly eliminate risk)

**Mitigation Strategies**: [List available mitigation strategies]

### Reversibility Assessment

**Ability to Undo Damage if Risk Materializes**: [1-10]
- 1-3: Low reversibility (permanent damage)
- 4-6: Moderate reversibility (significant but recoverable)
- 7-9: High reversibility (mostly recoverable)
- 10: Very high reversibility (fully recoverable)

**Recovery Strategies**: [List recovery strategies if risk materializes]

## Risk Score Calculation

**Risk Score Formula**: (Probability × Impact) / (Mitigability × Reversibility)

**Calculation**:
- Probability: [X]
- Impact: [X]
- Mitigability: [X]
- Reversibility: [X]
- **Risk Score**: ([X] × [X]) / ([X] × [X]) = [X]

**Risk Score Interpretation**:
- <1.0: Very low risk
- 1.0-2.0: Low risk
- 2.0-5.0: Moderate risk
- 5.0-10.0: High risk
- >10.0: Very high risk
