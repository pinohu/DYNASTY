# SOP: Financial Cash Sweep Protocol
**Purpose:** To mitigate liability risk for "Hybrid" entities (like Kwode LLC) by regularly stripping excess cash to the protected Treasury (PNR Holdings).

**Frequency:** Monthly (1st of Month)
**Responsible:** CFO / Bookkeeper

---

## 1. The Logic
Operating companies (OpCos) are "High Risk" targets for lawsuits. Holding companies (HoldCos) are "Safe Harbors."
**Rule:** Never leave more cash in an OpCo than is needed for 30-60 days of operations.

## 2. The Protocol
1.  **Login** to Kwode LLC Bank Account.
2.  **Calculate** "Operating Needs":
    *   (Average Monthly Expenses x 1.5) = **Target Balance**.
3.  **Identify Excess:**
    *   (Current Balance) - (Target Balance) = **Sweep Amount**.
4.  **Execute Transfer:**
    *   Initiate ACH/Internal Transfer of [Sweep Amount] from Kwode LLC to PNR Holdings LLC.
    *   **Memo:** "Monthly Profit Distribution".
5.  **Record in QuickBooks:**
    *   Kwode Books: Debit Equity/Distribution.
    *   PNR Books: Credit Income/Distribution from Subsidiary.

## 3. Trigger Events (Immediate Sweep)
*   **Large Payment Received:** If a client pays a large lump sum (>$20k), sweep the profit portion immediately. Do not wait for the 1st of the month.
*   **Threat Level Rise:** If a legal threat is received, do **NOT** transfer assets (this is Fraudulent Conveyance). You must stick to the *regular* schedule established *before* the threat. This is why a consistent monthly schedule is critical defense.

## 4. Verification
*   [ ] Transfer confirmed.
*   [ ] PNR Holdings balance updated.
*   [ ] QBO transactions matched.
