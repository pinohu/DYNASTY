# The Ohu Legacy Codex Repository

## 🌟 Current Status: Active & Compiled (v5.0)

This repository contains the source code, manuscripts, and compilation tools for **The Ohu Legacy Codex**—the architectural blueprint for the Ohu Family Enterprise.

### 📂 Directory Structure (The Map)

*   **`manuscripts/` (⭐ SOURCE OF TRUTH)**: This folder contains the *active*, editable Markdown files for all Books and Volumes. **Make all edits here.**
    *   `Book_1_The_Foundation_Manuscript.md`
    *   `Book_2_The_Engine_Manuscript.md`
    *   `Volume_III_The_Digital_Ecosystem_Manuscript.md`
    *   ...and so on.
    *   `images/`: Contains all PlantUML diagrams referenced in the texts.

*   **`Ohu_Legacy_Codex_Compiled.md` (📄 OUTPUT)**: This is the **single, authoritative file** generated by the compilation script. It combines all manuscripts into one readable document. **Do not edit this file directly; it will be overwritten.**

*   **`compile_codex.py` (🛠️ TOOL)**: The Python script that merges the manuscripts into the compiled file.

*   **`ohu-legacy-codex/` (🗄️ ARCHIVE)**: This folder contains legacy templates, checklists, and previous version drafts. It is kept for reference but is *not* the active manuscript source.

### 🚀 How to Compile the Codex

If you edit any file in `manuscripts/`, you must re-compile the master document to see changes reflected there.

1.  Open a terminal in this root directory.
2.  Run the compilation script:
    ```bash
    python compile_codex.py
    ```
3.  The script will:
    *   Read all files from `manuscripts/` in the correct order.
    *   Generate a dynamic Table of Contents.
    *   Output the result to `Ohu_Legacy_Codex_Compiled.md`.

### 🖼️ Diagrams and Visuals

All diagrams are generated using **PlantUML**.
*   Source code for diagrams is embedded in the Markdown files (for future editing).
*   Rendered images (`.svg`) are stored in `manuscripts/images/`.
*   If you change a diagram's code, you must re-export the SVG and save it to the images folder.

### 📝 Style Guide

*   **Headers**: Use H1 (`#`) for Book Titles, H2 (`##`) for Chapters, H3 (`###`) for Sections.
*   **Links**: Use relative paths for images: `![Alt Text](./images/filename.svg)`.
*   **Notes**: Use `> Blockquotes` for key emphasis or mandates.
