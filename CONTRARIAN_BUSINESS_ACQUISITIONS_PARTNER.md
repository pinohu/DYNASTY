# **CHAPTER: THE CONTRARIAN BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS PARTNER (CBAP)**

## **How to Source, Evaluate, Finance, and Close Boring Businesses That Print Cash**

---

Most people who say they want to buy a business never actually do it.

They read books. They take courses. They bookmark listings. They talk about deals over coffee. And then they go back to their jobs, their startups, their excuses.

The Contrarian Business Acquisitions Partner (CBAP) exists to solve this problem. It's a tactical, end-to-end system designed to help you stop theorizing and start buying—specifically, boring, profitable, cash-flowing service businesses under $10M in revenue.

This isn't a framework for thinking about acquisition entrepreneurship. It's an execution engine. A playbook that walks you through every step: sourcing deals, filtering fast, valuing correctly, structuring seller-friendly financing, writing outreach scripts, negotiating terms, conducting due diligence, closing transactions, running your first 100 days, improving operations, and scaling through bolt-on acquisitions.

If you're serious about building wealth through business ownership—not through startup lottery tickets or passive index funds—this chapter will show you exactly how to use CBAP to get your first deal done, and your second, and your tenth.

Let's get to work.

---

## **WHO THIS SYSTEM IS FOR**

CBAP is built for:

- **First-time buyers** who want a repeatable process instead of wandering aimlessly through BizBuySell
- **Repeat buyers** looking to systematize deal flow and speed up evaluation
- **Search funders** running disciplined acquisition campaigns
- **Self-funded searchers** operating on limited capital and tight timelines
- **Roll-up operators** consolidating fragmented industries
- **Tradespeople** ready to own the businesses they've been working in
- **Investors** seeking predictable cash flow over speculative growth
- **Owners** hunting for bolt-on acquisitions to layer onto existing operations

This system is for people who prefer **boring cash flow over flashy startups**, who want **actionable steps instead of theory**, and who are willing to do the unglamorous work required to build real wealth.

If you want to buy a SaaS unicorn or disrupt an industry with blockchain, this isn't your system. If you want to own a plumbing company that throws off $200K a year while you sleep, keep reading.

---

## **WHAT THE SYSTEM PRODUCES**

CBAP isn't a vague methodology. It's a production line. For every deal you evaluate, the system generates specific, actionable outputs:

### **1. Quick Pass/Fail Assessment**
A brutally honest filter based on Codie Sanchez's "Ideal Business" criteria. Most deals fail here. That's the point.

### **2. A Complete DealCard**
A one-page decision tool summarizing revenue, SDE, EBITDA, DSCR, risks, and next actions. This becomes your single source of truth for every deal.

### **3. Seller Financing Avatar Score**
A 0–30 point scoring model that predicts how likely the seller is to offer financing. This changes everything about your negotiation strategy.

### **4. Valuation & Financing Model**
A back-of-the-envelope calculation covering SDE normalization, add-backs, multiples, buyer salary, operator salary, maintenance CapEx, growth reserves, debt service, and DSCR. You'll know within minutes if the numbers work.

### **5. Outreach Pack**
Templated scripts for brokers, owners, phone calls, emails, DMs, and document requests. Professional, credible, respectful—and fast.

### **6. Three-Offer Strategy**
A structured negotiation matrix presenting three options: lower price with higher cash, higher price with seller financing, and an earn-out tied to performance. Sellers love options. You love optionality.

### **7. LOI Draft**
A plain-language Letter of Intent outline for an asset purchase, ready to customize and send.

### **8. Seller Note Term Sheet**
Clear terms for a seller-financed portion of the deal.

### **9. Due Diligence Kit**
Comprehensive checklists covering financials, legal, HR, operations, market, customers, suppliers, assets, liabilities, and transition planning. Plus an issue log and closing timeline.

### **10. First 100-Day Plan**
A phased integration roadmap: stabilize (Days 1–30), systemize (Days 31–60), optimize (Days 61–90), and set your next 12-month targets (Days 91–100).

### **11. Growth Levers Plan**
Tactical improvements you can implement immediately: pricing hygiene, recurring revenue models, upsells, marketing fixes, operational efficiencies, and capacity expansion.

### **12. Bolt-On Acquisition Framework**
A repeatable process for identifying, valuing, financing, and integrating complementary businesses to compound your returns.

### **13. Weekly Sourcing & Accountability Plan**
A Monday-through-Sunday schedule that keeps your pipeline full and your deal flow consistent.

## **THE DEAL BOX: YOUR FILTER BEFORE THE FILTER**

Before you evaluate a single business, you must define your **Deal Box**.

This is non-negotiable. Without it, you'll chase shiny objects, waste time on bad fits, and dilute your focus. The Deal Box is a set of strict parameters that define what you're hunting for—and what you'll ignore, no matter how attractive it looks.

Your Deal Box must include:

- **Minimum purchase price**: What's the floor? ($200K? $500K?)
- **Maximum purchase price**: What's the ceiling? ($2M? $5M?)
- **Desired annual income**: How much cash do you need to take home? ($100K? $250K?)
- **Buyer role**: Are you operating full-time, semi-absentee, or absentee?
- **Operator salary** (if hiring someone to run it): Budget $50K–$150K depending on complexity.
- **Cash available / down payment**: How much liquidity do you have? (10%? 20%? All cash?)
- **DSCR tolerance**: What's your minimum debt service coverage ratio? (Most buyers want ≥1.5×)
- **Preferred financing type**: SBA 7(a)? Seller financing? Cash? A blend?
- **Maximum acceptable seller dependence**: Can you tolerate a founder-dependent business, or do you need a team in place?
- **Industry focus**: Blue-collar services? B2B? Local retail?
- **Geography**: Are you willing to relocate? Or only buying within 50 miles of home?
- **Must-haves**: Recurring revenue? Recession-resistant? Contracts?
- **Cannot-stands / exclusion criteria**: Restaurants? Medical licensing? Seasonal volatility? Retail? Franchises?
- **Minimum years in business**: 3 years? 5 years? 10 years?
- **Maximum acceptable team size**: Do you want 5 employees or 50?

**If a deal doesn't fit your Deal Box, it's a pass. No exceptions.**

The Deal Box prevents distraction. It creates investor discipline. It ensures you don't waste time falling in love with businesses that will never work for you.

Write your Deal Box down. Tape it to your wall. Review it every Monday. Don't negotiate with yourself.

## **THE DEALCARD: YOUR SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**

Every deal you evaluate gets condensed into a **DealCard**—a one-page snapshot that tells you everything you need to know.

Here's what's on it:

## **CODIE'S IDEAL BUSINESS FILTER**

This is the gatekeeper. Most deals don't make it through. That's how it should be.

The filter has seven gates. If a business fails any one of them, you pass. No exceptions. No "but this one's special." No "I can fix that later."

Here's the filter:

### **Gate 1: Revenue Under $10M**
Small businesses have less competition from institutional buyers, trade at lower multiples, and are easier to finance with seller notes or SBA loans.

### **Gate 2: Profitable Today**
You're not buying a turnaround project. You're buying cash flow. If it's not profitable now, it's not a business—it's a job with extra risk.

### **Gate 3: Net Margin ≥15%**
This ensures enough cushion for debt service, buyer income, operator salary, growth reserves, and the inevitable surprises. Below 15%, the margins are too thin.

### **Gate 4: Service-Based Business**
Service businesses are easier to understand, require less inventory and working capital, and scale through labor and process—not complex supply chains or manufacturing infrastructure.

### **Gate 5: Fragmented Industry**
You want industries with thousands of small operators, not three dominant players. Fragmentation means less competition, easier bolt-on acquisition opportunities, and better pricing power locally.

### **Gate 6: Non-Proprietary, Not Founder-Dependent**
The business should be transferable. If it relies on the founder's unique genius, personal relationships, or proprietary technology, it's not a business—it's a personality cult. You're buying systems, not wizards.

### **Gate 7: Cash Flow Can Cover Everything**
After debt service, the business must generate enough cash to:
1. Pay you (the buyer) a meaningful salary
2. Pay an operator (if you're not running it full-time)
3. Fund growth reserves
4. Cover maintenance CapEx

If the math doesn't work, the deal doesn't work. Walk away.

---

This filter saves you time, protects you from bad decisions, and prevents you from chasing "sexy" deals that will destroy your wealth.

Use it ruthlessly.

## **SELLER FINANCING AVATAR: SCORING THE DEAL**

One of the most powerful levers in small business acquisition is **seller financing**—where the seller agrees to take part of the purchase price over time, rather than demanding all cash at close.

Seller financing reduces your capital requirements, improves your DSCR, signals seller confidence in the business, and often gets deals done that banks won't touch.

But not every seller will agree to it. That's where the **Seller Financing Avatar Score** comes in.

This is a 30-point scoring model that predicts how likely a seller is to offer financing. It's based on 14 factors that indicate motivation, flexibility, and financial need for an income stream.

### **The 14 Factors (Max 30 Points)**

1. **Long Operating History** (2 pts): Business has been around 10+ years. Stability signals less urgency to exit.

2. **Owner Tenure** (2 pts): Owner has been in the business 10+ years. Long tenure = emotional attachment, legacy concerns.

3. **Owner Age** (3 pts): Owner is 60+ years old. Retirement motivation is high.

4. **No Successor Alignment** (3 pts): No family member or key employee ready to take over. Seller has no internal exit option.

5. **Low Buyer Competition** (2 pts): Few buyers are circling. Seller has limited negotiating leverage.

6. **Brick-and-Mortar** (1 pt): Physical location ties the business to the community. Seller may want to see it continue.

7. **Messy Books** (2 pts): Financials are disorganized or incomplete. Banks won't lend, so seller financing becomes the only path.

8. **Overpriced vs. Balance Sheet** (2 pts): Asking price is 30%+ above asset value. Seller is emotionally attached and pricing high. You can negotiate down with creative structure.

9. **Unclean Financials** (2 pts): Personal expenses mixed in, inconsistent reporting. Seller knows a bank won't approve; seller financing is the workaround.

10. **No Leadership Team** (2 pts): Owner runs everything. Buyer will need time to transition, and seller financing aligns incentives.

11. **Some Distress** (2 pts): Health issues, burnout, partnership dispute. Seller wants out but needs income security.

12. **Relationship / Trust** (2 pts): You've built rapport. Seller likes you and wants to see the business in good hands.

13. **Prefers Income Stream** (2 pts): Seller doesn't want a lump sum (tax hit, reinvestment risk). Monthly payments are more attractive.

14. **Other Income Sources** (3 pts): Seller has rental income, pension, or other assets. Can afford to wait for payments.

### **Scoring Outcome**

- **0–11 points**: **Low** likelihood. Expect to need bank financing or cash.
- **12–20 points**: **Medium** likelihood. Seller financing is possible with the right structure.
- **21–30 points**: **High** likelihood. Lead with seller financing in your offer.

---

This score changes everything about how you approach the deal. If the score is high, you structure your offer around seller financing from the start. If it's low, you focus on bank financing and use seller financing as a fallback.

---

## **VALUATION & FINANCING MODEL**

Now we get into the numbers. This is where most buyers freeze up. Don't.

Valuing a small service business isn't complex. It's straightforward math, grounded in cash flow and industry norms.

Here's how to do it:

### **Step 1: Normalize SDE (Seller's Discretionary Earnings)**

SDE is the cash benefit the owner extracts from the business. To calculate it, start with net income and add back:

- Owner's salary
- Owner's benefits (health insurance, car, travel, etc.)
- One-time expenses (lawsuit settlement, equipment purchase, etc.)
- Personal expenses run through the business (country club, family cell phones, etc.)
- Non-operating income or expenses

You're trying to answer: *How much cash does this business actually generate for the owner?*

### **Step 2: Apply a Multiple**

Small service businesses typically trade at **2–4× SDE**. The multiple depends on:

- **Recurring revenue**: Higher multiples (3.5–4×)
- **Contracts**: Long-term contracts justify higher multiples
- **Churn**: Low churn = higher multiple
- **Key-person risk**: Founder-dependent businesses = lower multiple (2–2.5×)
- **Industry**: HVAC, plumbing, landscaping = 2.5–3.5×. Niche B2B services = 3–4×.

For a rough valuation:

**Valuation = Normalized SDE × Multiple**

Example:
- SDE = $400K
- Multiple = 3×
- Valuation = $1.2M

### **Step 3: Model the Financing**

Now you need to see if the deal works financially. Here's the formula for annual debt service:

**Annual Debt Service = Loan Amount × (r/12) ÷ (1 – (1 + r/12)^(-n)) × 12**

Where:
- `r` = annual interest rate (e.g., 0.075 for 7.5%)
- `n` = total number of months (e.g., 120 for 10 years)

For SBA 7(a) loans, assume:
- **10-year amortization**
- **Prime + 2.5%** (roughly 7.5%–8.5% as of 2024)
- **10–20% down payment**

For seller financing, assume:
- **5–10 year term**
- **5–7% interest**
- **10–30% of purchase price**

### **Step 4: Calculate DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)**

This is the most important number. It tells you if the business generates enough cash to cover debt payments.

**DSCR = (SDE – Buyer Salary – Operator Salary – CapEx – Growth Reserve) ÷ Annual Debt Service**

You want **DSCR ≥ 1.5×**. Below 1.25×, the deal is too tight. Below 1.0×, the deal doesn't work.

Example:
- SDE: $400K
- Buyer salary: $100K
- Operator salary: $0 (you're running it)
- CapEx reserve: $20K
- Growth reserve: $20K
- **Cash available for debt**: $260K
- Annual debt service: $160K
- **DSCR**: $260K ÷ $160K = **1.625×** ✅

This deal works.

---

If the DSCR is below 1.5×, you have three options:

1. **Negotiate a lower price**
2. **Increase the seller note portion** (lower debt service)
3. **Walk away**

Don't convince yourself a tight deal will work. It won't.

---

## **OFFER STRATEGY: THE THREE-OPTION MATRIX**

When you're ready to make an offer, don't present one number. Present three options.

Sellers love options. Options create perceived control. Options make you look flexible and sophisticated. And options give you negotiation room.

Here's the structure:

### **Option A: Lower Price, Higher Cash**

- Purchase price: $1.0M (discounted from $1.2M ask)
- Down payment: 20% ($200K)
- Bank loan: 80% ($800K)
- Seller note: 0%
- Rationale: "Quick close, clean exit, all cash within 30 days."

### **Option B: Higher Price, Lower Cash + Seller Note**

- Purchase price: $1.2M (full ask)
- Down payment: 10% ($120K)
- Bank loan: 60% ($720K)
- Seller note: 30% ($360K at 6% over 7 years)
- Rationale: "You get your full asking price, I reduce my risk, and you get a steady income stream."

### **Option C: Earn-Out Tied to Performance**

- Base purchase price: $1.0M
- Earn-out: Up to $200K over 3 years if revenue or gross profit targets are met
- Down payment: 15% ($150K)
- Bank loan: 65% ($650K)
- Seller note: 20% ($200K)
- Rationale: "We share the upside if the business performs well."

---

Present all three. Let the seller choose. You'll often be surprised which one they pick.

And here's the key: **Option B is usually your target**. It's seller-friendly (full price), buyer-friendly (lower cash at close), and signals that you're willing to bet on the business alongside them.

---

## **OUTREACH PACK: SCRIPTS THAT WORK**

You can't buy a business if you can't start a conversation. Here are the scripts you need.

### **Broker Email Script**

Subject: Inquiry – [Business Name] – Qualified Buyer, Moving Fast

---

Subject: Interested in [Business Name] – Flexible Timeline, Seller Financing Possible

---

Hi [Owner Name],

I'm [Your Name], and I'm interested in learning more about [Business Name].

I'm not a private equity firm or a flipper. I'm an individual buyer looking to acquire and operate a business in [Industry/Region]. I'm particularly interested in businesses with strong cash flow, loyal customers, and an owner ready to transition on their timeline—not mine.

I'm flexible on structure and open to seller financing if that's appealing to you. I'd love to have a brief conversation to learn about your goals and see if there's a fit.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Phone]

---

### **Phone Script (60–90 Seconds)**

*"Hi [Owner Name], this is [Your Name]. I saw your business listed on [Platform] and wanted to reach out directly. I'm looking to acquire a business in [Industry], and yours caught my attention.*

*Quick background: I've worked in [related experience], I have financing in place, and I'm looking for something I can run long-term, not flip.*

*Could I ask you a few quick questions?*

*[If yes]:*

- What's the current annual revenue?
- What's the SDE or owner benefit?
- Why are you looking to sell?
- How many hours a week are you working in the business?
- How many employees?
- Any long-term contracts or recurring revenue?

*Thanks for your time. If it seems like a fit, I'd love to set up a longer conversation. What's the best way to follow up?*"

---

### **Document Request List**

When you're ready to dig deeper, request:

- Last 3 years of Profit & Loss statements
- Last 3 years of tax returns
- Balance sheet (most recent)
- Accounts receivable aging report
- Accounts payable aging report
- Customer list (anonymized if necessary)
- Vendor/supplier list
- Payroll summary (roles, salaries, tenure)
- List of equipment and assets
- Lease agreements
- Licenses, permits, insurance policies
- Any pending or past litigation
- Organizational chart
- Any debt or lien information

---

### **Key Mantra: "Be Good. Be Brief. Be Gone."**

Respect people's time. Don't oversell. Don't overstay. Be professional, be prepared, and be quick.

Most owners and brokers are drowning in tire-kickers. Stand out by being competent and respectful.

---

## **SOURCING PLAYBOOK: WHERE TO FIND DEALS**

You won't find deals sitting on your couch. Sourcing is an active discipline.

Here's where to look:

### **On-Market Sources**

These are businesses actively for sale, usually through brokers:

- **BizBuySell**: The largest online marketplace. Expect competition.
- **BizQuest**: Similar to BizBuySell, slightly smaller inventory.
- **LoopNet**: Commercial real estate listings, often includes businesses.
- **BizScout**: AI-powered deal aggregator.
- **Local Brokers**: Sunbelt Business Brokers, Transworld Business Advisors, local boutique firms.

On-market deals are easier to find but more competitive. Expect to pay closer to asking price.

### **Off-Market Sources**

These are businesses not officially for sale—but the owners might be open to selling:

- **Google Maps**: Search "[your industry] near me." Call businesses directly.
- **Yelp**: Same strategy. Filter by reviews, longevity.
- **Chamber of Commerce directories**: Local, community-focused businesses.
- **Facebook Groups**: Local business groups, "Businesses for Sale" groups, industry-specific groups.
- **LinkedIn**: Search for business owners in your target industry and geography. Message them.
- **Direct Mail**: Send letters to businesses in your target profile.
- **Supplier Introductions**: Talk to suppliers in your industry. They know who's struggling or retiring.
- **License Registries**: Many states publish lists of licensed contractors, plumbers, electricians, etc.
- **Local Events**: Attend chamber mixers, trade shows, community events.
- **Neighbors**: Talk to people. Tell them you're looking to buy a business. Word spreads.

Off-market deals take longer to source but offer better pricing, more flexible terms, and less competition.

### **Volume Expectation: The 50–100 Rule**

You need to review **50–100 listings** to find a handful worth pursuing.

Most deals are duds. That's fine. Volume beats genius.

Don't get discouraged. Keep sourcing. The more you see, the faster you'll recognize good deals.

---

### **Weekly Sourcing Cadence**

Consistency beats intensity. Here's your weekly rhythm:

- **Monday**: Message 5 business owners (Facebook, LinkedIn, email).
- **Tuesday**: Call or visit 2 local businesses in person.
- **Wednesday**: Attend a community event, industry meetup, or chamber mixer.
- **Thursday**: Follow up with prior leads. Check voicemails. Respond to emails.
- **Friday**: Review your personal P&L. Review one deal in depth.
- **Saturday**: Make 1 public post on social media establishing your identity as a buyer.
- **Sunday**: Update your pipeline tracker. Plan next week's sourcing activities.

---

This rhythm keeps your pipeline full without burning you out.

---

## **PIPELINE MANAGEMENT: TRACK EVERY DEAL**

You can't manage what you don't measure.

Every deal must be logged and tracked through the following stages:

1. **Lead**: Initial contact made.
2. **Conversation Started**: Owner/broker responded; initial info shared.
3. **In Negotiation**: Financials reviewed, offer discussions underway.
4. **Under LOI**: Letter of Intent signed; due diligence in progress.
5. **Closed**: Deal complete. You own the business.
6. **Dead/On Hold**: Deal fell apart or paused indefinitely.

Use a simple spreadsheet or CRM. Track:

- Deal name
- Industry
- Location
- Asking price
- Revenue
- SDE
- Stage
- Date of last contact
- Next action
- Notes

Review your pipeline weekly. Identify bottlenecks. Move deals forward or kill them.

Deals die in stagnation. Keep momentum.

---

## **DUE DILIGENCE: THE CHECKLIST THAT SAVES YOU**

Once you're under LOI, due diligence begins.

This is where you verify everything the seller told you—and uncover everything they didn't.

Due diligence is not optional. It's the difference between buying a cash-flowing business and buying a lawsuit with employees.

Here's the complete checklist:

### **Financial Due Diligence**

- Last 3 years of tax returns
- Last 3 years of P&L statements
- Balance sheets (monthly or quarterly)
- Cash flow statements
- Bank statements (last 12 months)
- Accounts receivable aging
- Accounts payable aging
- Debt schedule (all loans, lines of credit, leases)
- Any off-balance-sheet liabilities

### **Customer Due Diligence**

- List of top 10 customers (revenue concentration)
- Customer contracts (if any)
- Customer churn rate
- Customer acquisition cost
- Average customer lifetime value
- Any pending disputes or complaints

### **Supplier Due Diligence**

- List of key vendors and suppliers
- Vendor contracts or agreements
- Payment terms
- Any exclusive relationships
- Backup suppliers (redundancy check)

### **HR Due Diligence**

- Organizational chart
- Employee list (names, roles, salaries, tenure)
- Payroll records (last 12 months)
- Employee handbook
- Any union agreements
- Turnover rate
- Any pending HR issues or complaints
- Key employee retention risk

### **Legal Due Diligence**

- Business licenses (current and valid)
- Permits (zoning, environmental, health, safety)
- Insurance policies (general liability, professional liability, workers' comp, property, etc.)
- Pending or past litigation
- Contracts (customer, vendor, lease, etc.)
- Intellectual property (trademarks, copyrights, domain names)
- Compliance with local, state, and federal regulations

### **Operations Due Diligence**

- Equipment list (age, condition, maintenance records)
- Facility tour (if brick-and-mortar)
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Technology stack (software, systems, subscriptions)
- Inventory (if applicable)
- Scheduling and dispatch systems
- Job costing or project management systems
- Quality control processes

### **Market Due Diligence**

- Industry trends (growing, flat, declining?)
- Competitor analysis (who are they, what are they doing better?)
- Pricing positioning (premium, mid-market, discount?)
- Market saturation (room for growth?)
- Regulatory changes on the horizon

### **Assets & Liabilities**

- Real estate (owned or leased? Terms?)
- Equipment (owned, leased, financed?)
- Vehicles (owned, leased, financed?)
- Liens or encumbrances
- Environmental liabilities (especially for industrial businesses)

### **Transition Plan**

- Owner's transition timeline (30 days? 90 days? 6 months?)
- Owner's willingness to train and consult post-close
- Key customer introductions
- Key employee introductions
- Key vendor introductions

---

### **The Issue Log**

As you uncover problems, log them. For each issue, note:

- Description
- Severity (Low / Medium / High)
- Potential financial impact
- Proposed resolution
- Who's responsible (buyer, seller, third party)

Use the Issue Log to renegotiate price, adjust terms, or walk away if the issues are too severe.

---

### **The Closing Timeline**

Work backward from your target close date. Include:

- LOI signed
- Due diligence period (30–60 days typical)
- Financing approval
- Legal document drafting
- Final walkthrough
- Wire transfer
- Closing

Build in buffer time. Deals always take longer than expected.

---

## **FIRST 100 DAYS: YOUR INTEGRATION PLAYBOOK**

Congratulations. You closed the deal. You own the business.

Now comes the hardest part: not screwing it up.

The first 100 days are critical. This is where you stabilize operations, earn trust, identify quick wins, and set the foundation for growth.

Here's the plan:

---

### **Days 1–30: Stabilize and Listen**

**Goal**: Don't break anything. Build trust. Secure cash flow.

**Key Actions**:

- **Meet every employee** (one-on-one if possible). Learn names, roles, tenure, concerns.
- **Reassure customers**. Send a letter or email introducing yourself. Emphasize continuity.
- **Shadow the owner** (if they're staying for transition). Watch, listen, take notes.
- **Secure cash flow**. Ensure invoices are going out, receivables are being collected, payables are being paid.
- **Review financials weekly**. Compare actual performance to what was represented in due diligence.
- **Identify quick wins**. What's broken and easy to fix? (E.g., outdated website, no Google reviews, inefficient routing.)
- **Build relationships** with key customers, vendors, and employees.

**What NOT to do**:
- Don't make big changes yet.
- Don't fire anyone (unless they're actively stealing or incompetent).
- Don't rebrand or change pricing.
- Don't promise things you're not sure you can deliver.

Your job is to listen, stabilize, and earn trust.

### **Days 31–60: Systemize and Align**

**Goal**: Document processes, establish KPIs, clarify roles.

**Key Actions**:

- **Document SOPs** (Standard Operating Procedures). How do you acquire customers? Deliver service? Handle complaints? Process payroll? Write it down.
- **Establish KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators). Track weekly revenue, gross margin, customer acquisition cost, employee utilization, etc.
- **Build dashboards**. Create a simple one-page weekly report showing the numbers that matter.
- **Clarify roles and responsibilities**. Make sure everyone knows what they're accountable for.
- **Implement weekly team meetings**. 15–30 minutes. Review the week, celebrate wins, address issues.
- **Start training**. Cross-train employees so you're not dependent on one person.

**What NOT to do**:
- Don't over-complicate systems. Simple beats sophisticated.
- Don't micromanage. Delegate and verify, don't hover.

Your job is to bring order to chaos and create predictable processes.

### **Days 61–90: Optimize and Grow**

**Goal**: Improve margins, increase revenue, build momentum.

**Key Actions**:

- **Adjust pricing**. Look for underpriced services. Raise prices 5–10% on new customers first.
- **Renegotiate vendor contracts**. You're a new buyer. Vendors will often offer better terms to earn your loyalty.
- **Launch upsells**. What additional services can you offer existing customers? (E.g., plumber adds water heater maintenance plans.)
- **Improve marketing**. Update the website. Launch a Google reviews campaign. Start a referral program.
- **Improve routing and efficiency**. Can you reduce drive time? Optimize schedules? Reduce waste?
- **Add capacity**. Hire one more technician, salesperson, or admin if you're turning away work.

**What NOT to do**:
- Don't chase shiny objects. Stick to your core business.
- Don't over-expand. Grow methodically.

Your job is to build on the foundation you've stabilized and start generating returns.

### **Days 91–100: Review and Set the Next 12-Month Plan**

**Goal**: Step back, assess progress, and plan your next phase.

**Key Actions**:

- **Review financial performance**. Compare months 1–3 post-acquisition to the trailing 12 months pre-acquisition.
- **Celebrate wins**. Acknowledge what's working.
- **Identify what's not working**. Be honest about mistakes and course-correct.
- **Set 12-month targets**. Revenue, margin, customer count, employee count, systems implemented, etc.
- **Identify bolt-on opportunities**. Are there complementary businesses you can acquire to layer on top of this one?
- **Plan your growth levers**. (More on this in the next section.)

## **GROWTH LEVERS: SIMPLE IMPROVEMENTS THAT COMPOUND**

Most small businesses are terribly run. That's why they're for sale.

This is good news for you. It means there are easy, repeatable improvements you can make to increase revenue and margins without reinventing the wheel.

Here are the most powerful growth levers:

### **1. Pricing Improvement**

Most small business owners underprice their services. They compete on price instead of value.

**Tactic**: Raise prices 5–10% on new customers immediately. Raise prices 3–5% annually on existing customers (with notice and explanation).

**Expected Impact**: 5–10% margin improvement.

### **2. Recurring Revenue Creation**

One-time transactions are volatile. Recurring revenue is predictable.

**Tactic**: Offer maintenance plans, subscription services, or retainer agreements.

Examples:
- HVAC: Annual maintenance plan ($200/year)
- Plumbing: Water heater inspection plan ($15/month)
- Landscaping: Monthly lawn care ($150/month)

**Expected Impact**: 10–30% of revenue becomes recurring within 12 months.

### **3. Upsells and Cross-Sells**

You already have the customer's attention. Offer them more.

**Tactic**: Train your team to suggest additional services during every interaction.

Examples:
- Plumber fixing a leak? Offer to inspect the water heater.
- Landscaper mowing the lawn? Offer seasonal cleanup or irrigation repair.

**Expected Impact**: 10–20% revenue lift.

### **4. Reviews Campaign**

Most small businesses have 5–20 Google reviews. You should have 100+.

**Tactic**: Automate review requests. Send an email or text after every job asking for a review. Offer a small incentive (e.g., "$10 off your next service").

**Expected Impact**: More inbound leads, less reliance on paid ads, higher close rates.

### **5. Website Improvements**

Most small business websites look like they were built in 2005. Fix that.

**Tactic**: Hire a freelancer on Upwork or Fiverr to redesign your site for $500–$2,000. Focus on mobile responsiveness, clear calls-to-action, and customer testimonials.

**Expected Impact**: 20–50% improvement in inbound lead conversion.

### **6. Referral Program**

Your best customers will refer you—if you ask.

**Tactic**: Offer a $50–$100 credit for every successful referral.

**Expected Impact**: 5–15% of new customers come from referrals.

### **7. Efficiency Improvements**

Waste is everywhere. Find it and kill it.

**Tactic**: Track technician utilization. Optimize routing. Reduce windshield time. Improve job costing.

**Expected Impact**: 5–10% margin improvement.

### **8. Cash Flow Management**

Improve how fast you collect receivables and how slow you pay payables (without damaging relationships).

**Tactic**: Offer discounts for early payment. Charge late fees. Move to net-15 instead of net-30 terms.

**Expected Impact**: Better working capital, less reliance on lines of credit.

### **9. Territory Expansion**

If you're crushing it in one city, expand to the next.

**Tactic**: Hire a second crew, open a second location, or acquire a competitor in an adjacent market.

**Expected Impact**: 20–100% revenue growth within 12–24 months.

These are simple, boring improvements. That's the point.

You don't need to innovate. You need to execute.

## **BOLT-ON ACQUISITIONS: COMPOUNDING YOUR RETURNS**

Once you've stabilized and grown your first acquisition, the next move is to layer on complementary businesses.

This is called a **bolt-on acquisition**, and it's one of the fastest ways to scale.

Here's how it works:

### **Step 1: Define Strategic Fit**

A bolt-on should:
- Serve the same customer base
- Operate in the same geography
- Offer complementary services
- Share overhead (admin, marketing, vehicles, etc.)

Example:
- You own a plumbing company. You acquire an HVAC company. Same customers, same trucks, same dispatch system.

### **Step 2: Source Complementary Businesses**

Use the same sourcing methods. Look for businesses with:
- Lower margins (you can improve them by integrating overhead)
- Weak marketing (you already have a customer list to cross-sell to)
- Owner burnout (less competition for the deal)

### **Step 3: Evaluate Cost Synergies**

What costs can you eliminate by combining operations?

Examples:
- Shared dispatch and admin staff
- Consolidated marketing budget
- Volume discounts with vendors
- Shared facilities or vehicles

### **Step 4: Evaluate Revenue Synergies**

What revenue can you unlock by cross-selling?

Examples:
- Plumbing customers need HVAC services
- HVAC customers need plumbing services
- Existing customer list = instant distribution for new service line

### **Step 5: Value Bolt-Ons at a Discount**

Because you can integrate and improve the business faster than a standalone buyer, you should pay less.

**Tactic**: Offer 2–2.5× SDE for a bolt-on, even if standalone businesses trade at 3–3.5×.

Justify it with synergies and speed.

### **Step 6: Finance It**

Options:
- Use cash flow from Business #1
- Seller financing (even more attractive for bolt-ons, since you have a track record)
- SBA expansion loan

### **Step 7: Integration Plan**

Within 90 days:
- Consolidate admin and dispatch
- Train teams to cross-sell
- Combine marketing efforts
- Standardize pricing and processes

### **Step 8: Measure Success**

Track:
- Combined revenue growth
- Combined EBITDA improvement
- Cost savings achieved
- Cross-sell conversion rate

---

**Expected Impact**: Bolt-ons can increase EBITDA by 30–100% within 12 months.

---

This is how you build a roll-up. Buy one business. Improve it. Use it as a platform to acquire and integrate complementary businesses. Repeat.

Within 5 years, you can own a $10M+ business generating $1M–$2M in annual cash flow.

## **ACCOUNTABILITY & DISCIPLINE: THE WEEKLY RHYTHM**

Buying businesses requires discipline. It's easy to get distracted, lose momentum, or convince yourself you're too busy.

Here's how to stay accountable:

### **Weekly Outreach Minimums**

Set non-negotiable weekly targets:

- Contact 5 new business owners
- Follow up with 5 existing leads
- Review 10 new listings
- Log every interaction in your pipeline tracker

If you hit these numbers every week, you'll have a full pipeline within 90 days.

### **Pipeline Health Metrics**

Track:

- Number of active leads
- Number of conversations started
- Number of NDAs signed
- Number of financials reviewed
- Number of LOIs submitted
- Number of deals closed

Measure what matters. Adjust your strategy based on what's working.

### **Identity Reinforcement**

You are a business buyer.

Not "someone thinking about buying a business."
Not "someone who might buy a business someday."

You are a business buyer.

Say it out loud. Tell people. Post about it. Make it your identity.

Identity drives behavior. Behavior drives results.

### **No-Excuses Contrarian Mindset**

- You don't need an MBA.
- You don't need industry experience.
- You don't need $1M in the bank.
- You don't need permission.

You need discipline, consistency, and the willingness to do boring work that most people won't do.

Stop waiting. Start sourcing.

## **ETHICS & GUARDRAILS**

CBAP is a powerful system. Use it responsibly.

Here are the boundaries:

### **Do Not Fabricate**

- Do not fabricate financial numbers.
- Do not fabricate credentials or experience.
- Do not misrepresent your financial strength to lenders or sellers.

### **Do Not Deceive**

- Be honest with sellers about your intentions.
- Be honest with lenders about your qualifications.
- Be honest with employees about your plans.

### **Seek Professional Guidance**

CBAP is educational. It is not legal, tax, or financial advice.

Always consult:
- An attorney (for LOIs, contracts, entity structure)
- A CPA (for tax implications, financial due diligence)
- An SBA lender or broker (for financing)

### **Respect the Process**

Brokers, sellers, and lenders are people. Treat them with respect.

Don't ghost. Don't lowball. Don't waste time.

Be professional. Be competent. Be credible.
