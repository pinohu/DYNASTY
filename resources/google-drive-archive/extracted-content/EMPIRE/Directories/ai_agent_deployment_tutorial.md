## Introduction to AI Agents

AI agents are autonomous software entities that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In our architecture, we use a hierarchical multi-agent system with three layers:

1. **Strategic Layer**: High-level decision making and business management
2. **Tactical Layer**: Operational workflow management
3. **Execution Layer**: Specific task execution

This tutorial will guide you through deploying and configuring each layer of agents.
