## Conclusion
Google Maps Scraper by Outscraper is a capable lead generation tool that effectively extracts business data from Google Maps. At $129 for lifetime access, it offers good value for users who need consistent local business data. However, the tool comes with significant billing concerns that potential buyers should carefully consider. Multiple users report unexpected additional charges beyond the AppSumo deal, particularly when using enrichment services or exceeding monthly credit limits. The founder team is responsive and explains that the LTD covers specific services only (5000 Google Maps places and 5000 emails monthly), with additional services billed separately. The monthly credits don't accumulate, which can lead to overage charges. While the tool works well for its intended purpose, the complex billing structure and reports of "hidden charges" make it a cautious recommendation. Users should carefully read the terms, monitor their usage, and contact support to clarify billing before committing to heavy usage. For basic Google Maps scraping within the monthly limits, it can be a valuable tool, but users should be prepared for potential additional costs if they need more comprehensive features or exceed the included credits.
