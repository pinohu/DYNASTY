## Conclusion
GoZen Forms.Ai is NOT RECOMMENDED due to critical issues with account access, customer support, and contract violations. Despite initially appearing to be a capable form builder with good features, the company has locked AppSumo customers out of their accounts and is demanding additional subscription payments despite lifetime deal purchases. AppSumo has issued an official warning and is offering refunds in credits until May 30th, 2025. Users report losing access to all their forms and data, with some needing to spend 40+ hours rebuilding their systems on alternative platforms. The company's unresponsive customer support and unwillingness to cooperate with AppSumo demonstrates poor business practices that make it unsuitable for any business-critical applications. There are many reliable alternatives available (Typeform, Google Forms, JotForm) that offer better support, data security, and honest pricing models. If you currently own this deal, consider requesting a refund through AppSumo support before the May 30th deadline.
