## AppSumo Status Analysis

### Why Never on AppSumo
- **Mac-Only Platform**: Limited to macOS users only
- **Niche Market**: Specialized tool for developers
- **Premium Positioning**: Positioned as high-end professional tool
- **Platform Limitations**: AppSumo typically focuses on cross-platform tools
- **Business Model**: Transitioned to free model, eliminating need for deals

### Current Status (2025)
- **Free Tool**: No longer requires purchase
- **RapidAPI Integration**: Part of larger RapidAPI ecosystem
- **Continued Development**: Actively maintained and updated
- **No Lifetime Deals**: Free model eliminates need for deals

## Recommendation
❌ **NOT AVAILABLE** - Never offered on AppSumo and now free

**Important Clarification:**
- **Never on AppSumo**: Paw was never offered as an AppSumo deal
- **Now Free**: RapidAPI for Mac is free for all users
- **Mac Only**: Limited to macOS platform
- **Not in Your Collection**: Should not be in owned products list

**For API Developers**: 
- **Free Alternative**: Download RapidAPI for Mac directly
- **No Purchase Needed**: Tool is now completely free
- **Mac Requirement**: Only works on macOS systems

## Alternative AppSumo API Tools
Since Paw was never offered, consider actual AppSumo API tools:
- **Apiway** - No-code API integration platform (has been on AppSumo)
- **Insomnia** - API testing tool (check if available)
- **Postman** - Popular API platform (not typically on AppSumo)
- **Bruno** - Open-source API client (not on AppSumo)

## Key Takeaways
Paw represents a case where a high-quality, specialized tool was never offered on AppSumo, likely due to its niche market (Mac-only API testing) and premium positioning. The tool has since been acquired by RapidAPI and made free, which actually provides better value than any potential lifetime deal would have.

For Mac-based developers, RapidAPI for Mac (formerly Paw) is an excellent free tool that doesn't require any AppSumo deal. The transition to a free model benefits all users and eliminates the need for lifetime deals.

The inclusion of Paw in an owned products list appears to be an error, as it was never available for purchase through AppSumo. Users interested in API testing tools should look for alternatives that have actually been offered on the platform.
