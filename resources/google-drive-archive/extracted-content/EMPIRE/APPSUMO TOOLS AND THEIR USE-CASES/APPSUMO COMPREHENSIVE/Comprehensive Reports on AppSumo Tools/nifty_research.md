Not as great as ClickUp or any of the hot new tools like Capacities, Height, or AppFlowy... as a LTD member (early supporter), I would have expected more respect from their support team. To date, it has been 13 days since I sent my original inquiry directly to team@niftypm.com. I followed up two days later and still no response."

- **Support responsiveness**: Some users report slow or unresponsive customer support
- **Feature gaps**: Missing some advanced features compared to ClickUp
- **Learning curve**: Some complexity for new users
- **Missing features**: Users request community support, better task relationships, advanced automation
