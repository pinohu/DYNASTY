### Recent User Reviews (2024-2025)

**Highly Positive Reviews:**

- **"Does the job with some added cool features"** (October 2024): 5/5 stars - "I have been using Noota for quite some time now and it has always been good at transcribing my meetings even though it can get some words wrong same as any other app. I know some others are unhappy with the support but I have never had any issues that required me to contact them."

**Critical Issues:**
- **"No upgrades"** (May 2025): 1/5 stars - "I bought tier 3 with the promess off getting the updates for the business plan even though most of the one that got improved never arrived for the AppSumo first investors. So the promess of 'futur improvement of the plan' never got actually kept which is not rely honest according to what was planed in the deal."

- **"Reasons why I do not recommend Noota"** (January 2025): 1/5 stars - "Support never answered my complaints about not being able to upload more videos. After the unpleasant customer experience I had, I purchased Fireflies with a much higher transcription speed, greater accuracy, and excellent support. I never had problems with upload throttling. I do not recommend Noota at all, and I 100% recommend Fireflies."

- **"Lost options :("** (November 2024): 1/5 stars - "I bought this app to make film subtitles and they remove this option. So it's useless for me."

### Common Concerns

- **Feature removal**: Some users report features being removed after purchase
- **Upload limitations**: Complaints about video upload throttling

- Monitor for any feature changes or limitations

**For Potential Buyers**:

The mixed reviews suggest it may work well for some users but could be problematic if you need support or encounter issues.
