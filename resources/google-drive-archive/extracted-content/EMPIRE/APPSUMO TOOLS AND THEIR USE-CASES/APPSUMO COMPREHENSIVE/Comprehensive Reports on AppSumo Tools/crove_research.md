- Significant technical problems with core functionality
- Document generation and template issues
- New watermarks added to AppSumo users' documents
- Team functionality problems
- Strong user warnings against purchase

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive document automation features
- Good integration capabilities
- E-signature functionality included
- Multi-language support
- API and webhook access

**Cons:**
- Deal is now sold out
- Major technical stability issues

**Value Assessment**: While Crove offers extensive features for document automation, the numerous reports of technical issues, platform instability, and user warnings suggest significant problems that outweigh the potential benefits. The founder's success metrics (300k USD revenue, 5000+ users) don't align with the poor user experience reports.

Since the AppSumo deal is sold out and has significant issues, consider:
1. **DocuSign**: Industry-standard e-signature platform
2. **PandaDoc**: Comprehensive document automation
3. **HelloSign**: Reliable e-signature solution
4. **Adobe Sign**: Enterprise-grade document workflows
