## Historical Context
FlyFin was offered on AppSumo as a 1-year free access deal to their AI-powered tax filing service, specifically targeting freelancers and self-employed individuals. The concept was promising - using AI to automatically find tax deductions and providing CPA support for professional tax filing. However, the execution appears to have been severely lacking based on user feedback. The single verified review on AppSumo tells a concerning story of a user who purchased the deal but was unable to access the service due to account verification issues and unresponsive customer support. This type of experience is particularly problematic for a tax service where users need reliable access during tax season. The fact that only one user left a review suggests either very low adoption or users abandoning the service before completing their experience. The 1-star rating and detailed complaints about customer service make this one of the poorest-performing deals in AppSumo's catalog. While the AI-powered tax deduction concept has merit, the execution and support infrastructure appear inadequate for a reliable tax service. Users seeking tax software for freelancers would be better served by established alternatives like TurboTax Self-Employed or FreeTaxUSA, which have proven track records and reliable customer support.
