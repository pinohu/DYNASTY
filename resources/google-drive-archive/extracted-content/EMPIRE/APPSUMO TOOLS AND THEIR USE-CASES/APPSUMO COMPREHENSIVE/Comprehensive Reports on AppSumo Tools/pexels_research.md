## AppSumo Status Analysis

- **Comparison Points**: Users compare paid stock photo deals to free Pexels
- **Alternative Mentions**: Cited as free alternative to paid stock photo services

## Recommendation
❌ **NOT APPLICABLE** - Free platform, no AppSumo deal needed

**Important Clarification:**
- **Always Free**: Pexels has always been completely free
- **No Deals Needed**: Free platform doesn't require lifetime deals
- **Not in Your Collection**: Should not be in owned products list
- **Integration Only**: Only appears in AppSumo context as integration option

- **No Purchase Required**: All content completely free
- **Commercial Use**: Safe for business and commercial projects
- **Unlimited Downloads**: No restrictions on usage

## Alternative AppSumo Stock Photo Deals
Since Pexels is free, consider actual AppSumo stock photo deals:
- **DepositPhotos** - Premium stock photos (frequently on AppSumo)
- **JumpStory** - Authentic stock photography (has been on AppSumo)
- **Storyblocks** - Stock photos and videos (check availability)
- **Twenty20** - Crowdsourced stock photos (check availability)

## Key Takeaways
Pexels represents a case where a high-quality service is completely free, eliminating any need for AppSumo deals. The platform provides millions of professional stock photos and videos at no cost, with full commercial usage rights.

The inclusion of Pexels in an owned products list appears to be a significant error, as Pexels has never charged for access and therefore has never been offered on AppSumo. The platform's business model is based on providing free content to users while supporting photographers through other means.

Users looking for stock photography should definitely use Pexels as a primary free resource, while considering AppSumo deals for premium stock photo services that offer additional features, exclusive content, or enhanced licensing options.

The mentions of Pexels in AppSumo contexts are typically as integration options for other tools or as comparison points when evaluating paid stock photo services.
