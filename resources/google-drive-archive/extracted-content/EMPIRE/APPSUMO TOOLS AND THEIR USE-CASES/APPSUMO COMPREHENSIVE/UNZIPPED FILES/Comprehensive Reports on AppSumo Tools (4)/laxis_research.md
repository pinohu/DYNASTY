## Conclusion

Laxis offers compelling meeting intelligence and transcription capabilities at an attractive price point through the AppSumo lifetime deal. The platform provides valuable features for sales teams, customer success managers, and business professionals who need to capture and organize meeting insights efficiently.

However, the platform is marred by significant concerns about business practices, with multiple users reporting that promised lifetime features have been moved to monthly subscription add-ons. The poor customer support and lack of transparency about feature changes raise serious questions about the company's commitment to AppSumo customers.

While the core transcription and meeting intelligence features work well, the ongoing controversies and trust issues make it difficult to recommend Laxis as a reliable long-term solution. Users considering this platform should carefully evaluate alternatives and be prepared for potential service limitations or additional costs.

**Overall Rating: 2.5/5** - Good features undermined by poor business practices and customer service issues.

**Status**: SOLD OUT on AppSumo - This was a limited-time lifetime deal that is no longer available. Current users should monitor their access and consider alternatives due to ongoing concerns about feature limitations and support quality.

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Multiple reports of features being moved to paid tiers and poor customer support make this a risky investment for business-critical use cases.
