## Recommendation

⚠️ **PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION** - While EmailDelivery.com offers exceptional technical capabilities and cost savings potential, the current support issues reported by AppSumo create significant business risk. 

**For Technical Users:** Consider as secondary/testing platform while maintaining primary ESP
**For Agencies:** Evaluate support risk vs. white-label revenue potential
**For Beginners:** Avoid until support issues are resolved
**Current Owners:** Take advantage of AppSumo's "We Got Your Back" guarantee if experiencing issues

The platform's technical merit is high, but operational reliability concerns make it unsuitable for business-critical email operations until support issues are resolved.
