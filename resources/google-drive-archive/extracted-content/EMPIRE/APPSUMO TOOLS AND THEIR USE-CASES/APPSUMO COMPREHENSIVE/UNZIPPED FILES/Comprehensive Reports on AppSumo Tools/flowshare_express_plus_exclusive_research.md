## Historical Context
FlowShare Express - Plus Exclusive was a promising process documentation tool on AppSumo that offered significant time savings for creating standard operating procedures and training materials. The concept of automatic process capture and documentation generation was excellent, and users who successfully used it reported dramatic time savings (from 3+ hours to 5 minutes for SOP creation). However, the product was plagued by serious technical issues including frequent crashes, data loss, and performance problems. While the founder was responsive and the price point was excellent at $69 for lifetime access, the reliability concerns made it a risky investment. The Express version also had significant limitations compared to the Professional version, missing key features like DOCX export. Despite these issues, for users who could work around the technical problems, it provided substantial value for process documentation needs.
