### User Reviews (2021-2025)

**Highly Positive Reviews:**
- **"used daily"** (June 2025): 5/5 stars - "Typedesk is a great tool that I use all of the time every day since we often write some of the same text. One issue that I have is that it doesn't automatically load even though I set it to. I also wish it did some sort of spellcheck to make it even more useful. When I restart I often have to load it manually once I realized I'm inputting my shortcut and its not working. Consistently a headache but I couldn't live without the tool so I'd buy again."

Better still I got 50 seats! Crazy! And even better still they just updated it with a native Chat GPT integration. This is how to deliver on a promise. Thank you. #tacofest"
