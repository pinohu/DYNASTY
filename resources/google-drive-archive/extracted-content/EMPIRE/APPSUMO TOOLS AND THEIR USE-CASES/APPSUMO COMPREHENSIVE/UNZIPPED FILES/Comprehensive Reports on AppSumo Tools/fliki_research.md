## Last Updated
January 2025 - Based on AppSumo sold out status and user reports of issues

## Critical Warning
**⚠️ FLIKI HAS SERIOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FEATURE DELIVERY ISSUES** - This product is sold out on AppSumo, which may be fortunate given the numerous credible reports of broken promises, missing features, and unresponsive support. Multiple users report that despite purchasing a lifetime deal with "all future updates," they are being excluded from new features and receiving only basic free account access. Users describe feeling scammed and report complete unresponsiveness from customer support. The company appears to be creating new plans specifically to exclude AppSumo lifetime users, which violates the spirit of the original deal. While the core concept of text-to-video conversion is valuable, the execution and customer treatment have been severely problematic. Users seeking text-to-video solutions should consider established alternatives with better track records of customer service and feature delivery.
