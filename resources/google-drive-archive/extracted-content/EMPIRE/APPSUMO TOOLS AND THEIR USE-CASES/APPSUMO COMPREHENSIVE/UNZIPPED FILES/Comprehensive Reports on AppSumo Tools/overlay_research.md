### User Reviews (2021-2022)

**Positive Reviews:**
- **"Blown Away"** (July 2022): 5/5 stars - "Pretty excited about this, and all of the possibilities this will open up for our design team. I'm still newer to Figma, but have enough basics down and just enough coding knowledge to start to work through the excellent Overlay tutorials, using the CSS/HTML options. Very well done, very unique and comprehensive walkthrough (made in Figma as an interactive file, of course). Very well done!"

- **"Must have deal for frontend engineers!"** (May 2021): 5/5 stars - "This is a unique no-code tool, I've tried the free trial & I was blown away bu the quality of the code and UX."

- **"A very useful tool"** (June 2021): 5/5 stars - "I'm using it a lot ... Overlay is really speeding things up ... In a blink of an eye (I mean this think is fast) you get clean and reusable code"

- **"One of best mock to code exporters I've worked with"** (May 2021): 5/5 stars - "A Free design system with hundreds of already made components and mocks that you can edit and export with Overlay!"

**Critical Issues:**
- **"Abandoned product - don't buy it"** (May 2022): 1/5 stars - "Even though the product is great, I wouldn't suggest to buy it since they really don't care about us as users, it seems that the Product & support is dead: - there hasn't been replies since January 2022. - no changes in changelog for 12 months. Don't buy it, it's abandoned product."

- **"Works, but lack of support"** (July 2022): 3/5 stars - "It works well, but I've recently encountered an error saying the plugin cant validate my components. There are no instructions to resolve the issue and there is no way to contact support. The contact section on the website also doesnt work. I hope they resolve the issue soon."

### Company Response (May 2024)
The founder team (Côme_Overlay) responded to abandonment concerns:
- "We are really sorry about that, we are not a full time team dedicated to the product, trying to do our best with a lot of questions from our users."
- "However, I can confirm the tool is working fine and our users show great satisfaction. On our side, we will improve it step by step, alongside with new Figma releases and updates!"
- "I'm sorry I cannot provide better answers, it is also why we decided to offer the tool to a pretty low price, as we don't offer much support."

## Recommendation
⚠️ **CAUTIOUSLY RECOMMENDED** - Good tool but limited support

**Why it has value:**
- **Excellent functionality**: When it works, it produces high-quality, clean code
- **Time-saving**: Significantly speeds up design-to-development workflow
- **Unique approach**: Effective Figma-to-code conversion with multiple framework support
- **Good tutorials**: Comprehensive learning resources
- **Mature product**: Well-developed core functionality

**Major concerns:**
- **Limited support**: Team admits they're not full-time and provide minimal support
- **Slow development**: Users report long gaps between updates
- **Contact issues**: Difficulty reaching support when problems arise
- **Small team**: Not a dedicated full-time development team

**For Current Owners**: 
- Good tool for basic Figma-to-code conversion needs
- Don't expect rapid support responses or frequent updates
- Use for straightforward conversions where the tool works well
- Have backup plans for complex projects

**For Potential Buyers**: 
- Deal is currently sold out
- Consider only if you don't need extensive support
- Good for teams that can work around occasional issues
- Evaluate alternatives with better support if mission-critical

## Alternative Solutions
- **Anima** - Figma to code conversion with better support
- **Figma Dev Mode** - Built-in Figma developer handoff features
- **Zeplin** - Design-to-development collaboration platform
- **Avocode** - Design handoff and code generation
- **Supernova** - Design system platform with code generation
- **Manual coding** - Traditional hand-coding approach

## Key Takeaways
Overlay offers a solid Figma-to-code conversion solution that produces clean, reusable code across multiple frameworks. The tool itself is well-regarded by users for its functionality and time-saving capabilities. However, the major drawback is the limited support and slow development pace due to the small, part-time team.

While the core functionality works well and users appreciate the quality of generated code, the lack of reliable support makes it risky for mission-critical projects. The team's honest admission about their limitations is refreshing but concerning for users who need dependable support.

For teams that can work independently and don't require extensive support, Overlay can be a valuable tool. However, those needing reliable support and frequent updates should consider alternatives with more dedicated development teams.
