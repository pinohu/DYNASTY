- **Customers cannot access their accounts**
- **Company appears to have shut down**
- AppSumo is offering refunds to eligible customers
- Deadline for refund requests: April 30th, 2025

### Recent User Reviews (2025)
- **"Class Action Lawsuit"** (April 2025): User lost valuable files, no notification about shutdown
- **"Noysi is down and appsumo is least bothered"** (March 2025): Service down for weeks, company took money and left
- Multiple users report complete loss of access to data and files
- Users describe feeling abandoned by both NOYSI and AppSumo

### Historical User Concerns
- Some users warned about risks of lifetime deals from newer companies
- Concerns about long-term viability and support
- Mixed experiences with customer service

## Recommendation
❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED - COMPANY FAILED**

**Critical Warning**: NOYSI has completely shut down as of February 2025. The company website is offline, all user accounts are inaccessible, and customers have lost access to their data and files. This represents a total failure of the lifetime deal promise.

**For Current Owners**: 
- Contact AppSumo support immediately at support@appsumo.com before April 30th, 2025 for potential refund
- Assume all data stored on NOYSI is permanently lost
- Migrate to alternative platforms immediately

**For Potential Buyers**: 
- Product is no longer available or functional
- Serves as a cautionary tale about lifetime deals from unestablished companies
- Consider established alternatives like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord

## Alternative Solutions
- **Slack** - Industry standard team communication
- **Microsoft Teams** - Enterprise-focused collaboration
- **Discord** - Gaming-focused but increasingly used for business
- **Mattermost** - Open-source Slack alternative
- **Rocket.Chat** - Self-hosted team communication

## Key Takeaways
This case highlights the risks associated with lifetime deals from newer companies. While NOYSI initially showed promise with good features and user feedback, the complete company shutdown demonstrates why established, financially stable companies are generally safer investments for critical business tools.
