### User Reviews (2023-2024)

**Highly Positive Reviews:**
- **"This app is incredible"** (October 2023): 5/5 stars - "I believe this is the greatest AppSumo deal ever offered."

- **"PROCESIO: The Easy-to-Use Process Automation Software"** (May 2023): 5/5 stars - Users praise its comprehensive automation capabilities and ease of use.

**Critical Issues:**
- **"I thought I loved it, but ultimately I didn't like it"** (May 2024): 2/5 stars - "The power of this tool is that it is low level. But this is also the greatest weakness."

**Detailed Criticism:**
- **Learning curve**: "Already the development of skills is long and very expensive"
- **Documentation issues**: "The documentation is good but on the tool we start with a blank sheet. There is no template. So it's hard to start."
- **Lack of pre-built integrations**: "If you want to make a connection with known standard tools: chatgpt, google, wordpress... There is no macro or pre-written code. We are therefore forced to type everything manually."
- **Too low-level**: "The real power is therefore to do full custom processing. But here it's so low level, that we could wonder the point of switching to process, rather than managing real code."
- **Not beginner-friendly**: "Non-coders will be lost, and coders will waste more time than coding it directly."

## Recommendation
WARNING: **CAUTIOUSLY RECOMMENDED** - Powerful but complex

**Why it has potential:**
- **Enterprise-grade platform**: Used by major corporations like Engie and EoN
- **Comprehensive capabilities**: True no-code to full-code flexibility
- **Significant value**: $49 for enterprise-level automation platform
- **Active development**: Responsive founder team with improvement plans
- **Scalable solution**: Cloud-based with unlimited projects and collaborations

**Major concerns:**
- **Steep learning curve**: Even experienced users find it challenging
- **Lack of templates**: Starting from scratch is difficult
- **No pre-built integrations**: Must manually code connections to popular services
- **Too technical for no-coders**: Despite no-code claims, requires significant technical knowledge
- **Time investment**: May take longer than coding solutions directly

**For Current Owners**: 
- Excellent for teams with technical expertise who need custom automation
- Invest time in learning the platform thoroughly
- Join the Discord community for support and tips
- Wait for promised template library improvements
- Consider it for complex, custom workflows that other tools can't handle

**For Potential Buyers**: 
- Deal is currently sold out
- Only suitable for technically skilled users
- Consider simpler alternatives like Zapier or Make for basic automation
- Good investment if you need enterprise-grade custom automation capabilities

## Alternative Solutions
- **Zapier** - User-friendly automation with pre-built integrations
- **Make (formerly Integromat)** - Visual automation platform
- **Microsoft Power Automate** - Enterprise automation solution
- **n8n** - Open-source workflow automation
- **Bubble** - No-code app development platform
- **Retool** - Low-code app building platform

## Key Takeaways
PROCESIO is a powerful, enterprise-grade automation platform that offers genuine no-code to full-code flexibility. However, it's significantly more complex than typical automation tools, requiring substantial technical knowledge even for "no-code" use cases.

The platform's strength lies in its ability to handle complex, custom automation workflows that other tools cannot manage. It's genuinely used by enterprise clients and offers professional-grade capabilities. However, the learning curve is steep, and the lack of pre-built templates and integrations means users must build everything from scratch.

For technically skilled teams needing custom automation solutions, PROCESIO offers exceptional value at the AppSumo price point. However, non-technical users or those seeking quick, simple automation should consider more user-friendly alternatives like Zapier or Make.

The active founder engagement and planned improvements (especially the template library) suggest the platform will become more accessible over time, but currently requires significant investment in learning and setup.
