## Historical Context
Formaloo was offered on AppSumo as a comprehensive no-code platform that combined form building, database creation, and mobile app development in a single solution. The platform positioned itself as a more powerful alternative to single-purpose form builders like Typeform or Google Forms, offering the ability to create not just forms and surveys, but also relational databases and simple mobile applications. Based on community discussions and third-party references, it appeared to be a legitimate and capable platform that offered good value for users needing more than basic form functionality. The fact that it was frequently mentioned in AppSumo user discussions and compared favorably to other tools suggests it had a positive reception among users who purchased the lifetime deal. However, like many AppSumo deals, it was time-limited and has since ended. The company continues to operate independently at formaloo.com, but without the lifetime access option that was available through AppSumo. Users who missed the AppSumo deal would need to subscribe to Formaloo's regular pricing plans or look for alternative form builders currently available on AppSumo. The removal of the product page (resulting in a 404 error) is standard practice for AppSumo when deals end, indicating this was a legitimate offering that simply reached its conclusion.
