### User Testimonials

#### Recent Highly Rated Reviews:
- **"Where Has This Been Hiding?"**: "Strewth, this is sooo simple yet sooo useful. The number of times I've recorded videos over the years and found sensitive info or images of 'subscribers' etc. where they complained they didn't want their faces shown. So I'd have to re-edit and re-upload after blurring them out. Now, at last, I can achieve this LIVE and no fiddly editing, double-checking, re-checking and so on. I love the fact that, even if the page reloads, the blurs stay in place. For the price, this is a must-have for anyone who presents online. It's gold dust in one simple browser extension."
