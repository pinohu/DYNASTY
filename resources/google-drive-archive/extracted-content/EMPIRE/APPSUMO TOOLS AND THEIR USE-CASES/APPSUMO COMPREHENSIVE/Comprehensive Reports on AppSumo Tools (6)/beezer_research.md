### Critical Security Concerns
**allengwinn** (238 deals): "Good Start but MAJOR Security Issue - ...after your user sign up, they receive an email containing their user ID and the password they signed up with. This means that Beezer absolutely stores clear-text passwords! This is a HUGE violation of Information Security standards!"

### Mixed Feedback
**dbalbi** (340 deals): "Beezer is great - It's still early days, but so far I'm delighted with Beezer. There are so many features. My only complaint is that the knowledge base isn't very comprehensive."
