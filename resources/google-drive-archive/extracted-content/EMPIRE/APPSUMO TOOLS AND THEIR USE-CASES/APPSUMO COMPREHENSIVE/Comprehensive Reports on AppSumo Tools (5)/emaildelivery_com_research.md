## Recommendation
⚠️ **HIGH RISK - PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION** for users who already own it

**Value Proposition**: Potentially exceptional value for email marketing infrastructure, but with significant platform risks
**Implementation Priority**: LOW - Due to major support and abandonment concerns

**Bottom Line**: EmailDelivery.com offers a compelling value proposition as a self-hosted email service provider with unlimited sending capabilities, white-label features, and significant cost savings compared to traditional ESPs. The platform's technical capabilities are robust, offering everything needed to run a professional email marketing service or agency. However, there are major concerns about platform viability and support that cannot be ignored. AppSumo has officially acknowledged that EmailDelivery has been unresponsive to customer support requests and is offering refunds through their "We Got Your Back" guarantee until April 11th, 2025. This indicates serious concerns about the platform's future viability. For users who already own this through AppSumo, the recommendation is to proceed with extreme caution. While the platform may still be operational, the lack of support and uncertainty about ongoing development makes it a high-risk investment. Users should consider this platform only if they have the technical expertise to manage it independently and have backup plans in place. The potential for platform abandonment makes it unsuitable for critical business operations or client services without significant risk mitigation strategies. If you choose to use this platform, implement it for non-critical applications initially, maintain regular backups of all data and configurations, and have alternative email service providers identified and ready to deploy. The combination of powerful features and lifetime pricing could provide exceptional value, but only for users who can accept and manage the significant platform risks involved.
