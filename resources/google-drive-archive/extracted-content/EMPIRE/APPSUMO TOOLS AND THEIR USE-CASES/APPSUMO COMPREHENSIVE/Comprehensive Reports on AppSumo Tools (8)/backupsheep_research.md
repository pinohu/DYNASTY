According to the GitHub repository by founder bilal414:
*"BackupSheep was a paid SaaS application from 2017 to 2023, serving over 6,500 users at its peak. Unfortunately, a poor decision to offer a lifetime deal (LTD) through AppSumo without proper due diligence led to a decline. As a result, BackupSheep was shut down in 2023."*

Based on verified user reviews and complaints:

**User Hamad05349 (Feb 2025)**:

- *"Instead of being properly compensated, we were contacted with a very trivial discount on a new website."*
- *"You have betrayed them by using their money to create a new service, and in return for our support, you offered us a trivial discount."*

**User Dolores (Jun 2024)**:
- *"All looked a bit of try and error and if it fails, the lifetime users get nailed."*
- *"This is part of the risk we take, fortunately it is the second backup deal that went to trash I paid quite a lot of money for."*

## 5. Critical Issues and Red Flags

### Business Model Failure
- **Unsustainable Economics**: Lifetime deals for storage services proved financially unviable

- **No Exit Strategy**: No proper migration path or data export options provided

## 9. Recommendations and Conclusion

### Immediate Actions for Affected Users
1. **Contact AppSumo Support**: Request full refund in credits or cash
2. **Document Losses**: Keep records of purchase and service disruption
3. **Migrate Backups**: Immediately implement alternative backup solutions
4. **Review Data**: Ensure no critical data was lost during service shutdown

### Future Purchase Guidelines
1. **Avoid Storage LTDs**: Never purchase lifetime deals for storage/infrastructure services
2. **Research Company Stability**: Investigate company funding, team size, and business model
3. **Diversify Backup Strategy**: Don't rely on single backup solution
4. **Read Terms Carefully**: Understand what happens if service shuts down

### Industry Implications
This case demonstrates the fundamental unsustainability of lifetime deals for infrastructure services. Storage, bandwidth, and server costs are ongoing operational expenses that cannot be covered by one-time payments, especially when the service provider only receives 30% of the deal revenue.

### Final Assessment: ⚠️ **NOT RECOMMENDED - SERVICE SHUT DOWN**

**Critical Warning**: BackupSheep permanently shut down in 2023 after taking users' money through AppSumo lifetime deals. The founder admits the AppSumo deal was a "poor decision" that led to the company's decline and closure. Users lost access to their backups and received inadequate compensation.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Service is Dead**: BackupSheep no longer exists as a functional service
2. **User Impact**: Thousands of users lost money and backup access
3. **Poor Handling**: Company provided inadequate compensation and communication
4. **Systemic Risk**: Demonstrates why lifetime deals for infrastructure services are unsustainable
5. **Avoid Similar Deals**: Be extremely cautious with any storage/backup lifetime deals

**Bottom Line**: This is a cautionary tale about the risks of lifetime deals for infrastructure services. The economics simply don't work when ongoing costs (storage, bandwidth, servers) must be covered by one-time payments. Users should stick to established backup providers with sustainable subscription models and proven track records.

**For Current AppSumo Users**: If you purchased this deal, immediately contact AppSumo support for a refund and implement alternative backup solutions. Do not rely on the promised open-source version, as it remains non-functional and provides no guarantee of service restoration.
