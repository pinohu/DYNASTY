## Critical urgency drives immediate action

Combined with **SBA lending projected to increase 10-12%** reaching $55-56 billion in 2025, and **80% of small business sales including seller financing**, acquisition financing has never been more accessible.

**Professional services automation markets** are exploding with 31.1% compound annual growth rates, while the "boring business" sectors you're targeting maintain recession-resistant characteristics with proven cash flows and real estate appreciation potential.
