## 4. Critical "Rules of Engagement"

1.  **Do Not Buy More Software**: You have 288 tools. You do not need #289. The $1000 is for **Labor**.
2.  **The VA is the Key**: If you try to do Days 6-14 yourself, you will fail. You must force yourself to teach, not do.
3.  **Imperfection is Allowable**: The Directory logo doesn't need to be perfect. The email script doesn't need to be Shakespeare. It needs to go **OUT**.
4.  **Protect the War Chest**: Do not spend the remaining $281 on "nice to haves." Keep it for emergency speed (e.g., if Hexomatic runs out of credits and you need to buy more instantly).

**"With $1,000 and a Map, you are more dangerous than a millionaire without a plan."**

## 5. What Happens Next? (Day 31+)
**Do not stop.**
Once you have survived the first 30 days, you must shift gears from "Launch" to "Scale."
