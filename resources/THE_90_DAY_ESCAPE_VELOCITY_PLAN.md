# The 90-Day Escape Velocity Plan: From "Hustle" to "Machine"
*Companion to the $1,000 Execution Plan*

## ⚠️ The Technician's Trap (Read This First)
You have survived Day 30. You likely have some revenue, a basic team member (VA), and a functioning CRM.
**The Danger Zone is Days 31-90.**
Most founders fail here because they try to "work harder" to scale.
*   **Day 1-30 Goal**: "Get a sale." (Hustle)
*   **Day 31-90 Goal**: "Build a machine that gets sales." (Systems)

**The Golden Rule of Phase 2:**
**"If you have to do it twice, the VA does it. If the VA does it twice, the Robot (Activepieces/ElectroNeek) does it."**

## Phase 2: Stabilization (Days 31-60)
**Objective**: Remove the Founder (You) from *Service Delivery*.
**Budget**: Re-invest 100% of Month 1 Profits.

### Week 5: The "Data Factory" Upgrade (Days 31-37)
*Goal: Move from manual "Autobound" campaigns to fully automated "Hexomatic" pipelines.*

*   **Day 31 (Monday): The Audit**
    *   **Founder**: Review Month 1 stats. Which directory niche got the most claims? Which email subject line worked?
    *   **Action**: "Kill" the losers. We double down ONLY on the winner.
    *   **VA Task**: Update the SuiteDash "CLOSER" pipeline. Archive dead leads.

*   **Day 34 (Thursday): The "Welcome" Sequence**
    *   **Action**: Write the "Claim Your Listing" email sequence in **VBOUT** (or SuiteDash Marketing).

        *   Email 2 (Day 3): "We're verifying phone numbers for [City] [Niche] providers."
        *   Email 3 (Day 7): "Last chance to claim your free badge."
    *   **VA Task**: Load templates into VBOUT.

## The "Self-Sustaining" Checklist (Day 90)
You are done with the "Launch" phase when:

1.  [ ] **Zero Delivery**: You do not perform the service. The VA or System does.
2.  [ ] **Zero Prospecting**: You do not send emails. Hexomatic/Autobound does.
3.  [ ] **Management Only**: You spend <10 hours/week on *operations*.
4.  [ ] **Cash Flow**: The business pays for all software + team + $2k/mo profit.
5.  [ ] **The "Hit by a Bus" Test**: If you disappeared for 2 weeks, the revenue would stay the same or grow.

**NEXT STEP**: Once you check all 5 boxes, proceed to **Volume VIII: Business Acquisition**. You are now ready to buy "Boring Businesses" because you have a machine to fix them.
