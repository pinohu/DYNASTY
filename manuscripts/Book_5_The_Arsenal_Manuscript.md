# Book 5: The Arsenal
## The Tactical Templates, Legal Weapons, and Financial Instruments of the Dynasty

**By Ikechukwu Ohu**

---

## Introduction to Book 5

If the previous books were the *Strategy*, this book is the *Weaponry*.

You cannot build a Dynasty with good intentions; you need ironclad contracts. The difference between an asset that survives a lawsuit and one that is seized is often a single clause in an Operating Agreement. The difference between a tax deduction and tax fraud is often a signed Board Resolution.

**Book 5: The Arsenal** is your repository of "Battle-Tested" legal and financial templates. These are not generic forms downloaded from the internet; they are engineered specifically for the multi-entity, multi-generational structure of the Ohu Empire.

### How to Use This Book
1.  **Customize**: Every template has [BRACKETED TEXT] that must be replaced with your specific details.
2.  **Review**: While these templates are robust, laws change. Have your local counsel review key documents every 3 years.
3.  **Execute**: A contract is worthless if it is not signed and dated.
