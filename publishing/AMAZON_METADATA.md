<p><b>The 365-Year Empire is not built on theory. It is built on documents.</b></p>

<p><i>The Arsenal</i> is the heavy-lifting companion to the Legacy Codex series. While the first four books provide the vision, strategy, and systems, Book 5 opens the vault. It provides the raw materials—the exact legal templates, operational checklists, and crisis management protocols—used to run the dynasty day-to-day.</p>

<p><b>This massive volume includes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Legal Template Library:</b> Draft agreements for Trusts, LLCs, and Contracts.</li>
<li><b>The Operational Checklist Vault:</b> Step-by-step protocols for everything from hiring to tax compliance.</li>
<li><b>Crisis Management Protocols:</b> What to do when things go wrong (lawsuits, market crashes, PR disasters).</li>
<li><b>The Vendor Directory:</b> How to vet and manage your professional team.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't just learn how to build the empire. Get the tools to build it.</p>
