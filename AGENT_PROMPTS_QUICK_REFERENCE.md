## HOW TO CREATE AN AGENT

### Step 1: Select the Agent Prompt
Open `AGENT_PROMPTS_COMPLETE.md` and find the agent you want to create (e.g., "AGENT 1: VOLUME I WRITER")

### Step 2: Copy the Complete Prompt
Copy the entire prompt block (everything between the triple backticks ```markdown and ```)

### Step 3: Create the Agent
Use your agent creation system and paste the prompt as the agent's instructions/system prompt

### Step 4: Verify Resources
Ensure all source materials referenced in the prompt are available:
- Framework documents (`Empire Book Outline.txt`, `Trust Structure - Comprehensive Framework.md`, etc.)
- Extracted resources in `resources/google-drive-archive/extracted-content/EMPIRE/`

### Step 5: Activate the Agent
Start the agent and it will begin writing according to the prompt specifications

- Agent 3 writes Volume III (after Volume II complete)
- ... continue through Agent 10

### Phase 3: Parallel Support (Throughout)

- Agent 12 reviews each volume as it's completed

### Phase 4: Final Compilation (Days 91-95)
